/// A view that asynchronously loads and displays an image.
///
/// This view uses the shared
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Foundation/URLSession>
/// instance to load an image from the specified URL, and then display it.
/// For example, you can display an icon that's stored on a server:
///
///     AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/icon.png"))
///         .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
///
/// Until the image loads, the view displays a standard placeholder that
/// fills the available space. After the load completes successfully, the view
/// updates to display the image. In the example above, the icon is smaller
/// than the frame, and so appears smaller than the placeholder.
///
/// ![A diagram that shows a grey box on the left, the SwiftUI icon on the
/// right, and an arrow pointing from the first to the second. The icon
/// is about half the size of the grey box.](AsyncImage-1)
///
/// You can specify a custom placeholder using
/// ``init(url:scale:content:placeholder:)``. With this initializer, you can
/// also use the `content` parameter to manipulate the loaded image.
/// For example, you can add a modifier to make the loaded image resizable:
///
///     AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/icon.png")) { image in
///         image.resizable()
///     } placeholder: {
///         ProgressView()
///     }
///     .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
///
/// For this example, SwiftUI shows a ``ProgressView`` first, and then the
/// image scaled to fit in the specified frame:
///
/// ![A diagram that shows a progress view on the left, the SwiftUI icon on the
/// right, and an arrow pointing from the first to the second.](AsyncImage-2)
///
/// > Important: You can't apply image-specific modifiers, like
/// ``Image/resizable(capInsets:resizingMode:)``, directly to an `AsyncImage`.
/// Instead, apply them to the ``Image`` instance that your `content`
/// closure gets when defining the view's appearance.
///
/// To gain more control over the loading process, use the
/// ``init(url:scale:transaction:content:)`` initializer, which takes a
/// `content` closure that receives an ``AsyncImagePhase`` to indicate
/// the state of the loading operation. Return a view that's appropriate
/// for the current phase:
///
///     AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/icon.png")) { phase in
///         if let image = phase.image {
///             image // Displays the loaded image.
///         } else if phase.error != nil {
///             Color.red // Indicates an error.
///         } else {
///             Color.blue // Acts as a placeholder.
///         }
///     }

    ///     AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/icon.png"))

    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - url: The URL of the image to display.
    ///   - scale: The scale to use for the image. The default is `1`. Set a

    /// Until the image loads, SwiftUI displays the placeholder view that
    /// you specify. When the load operation completes successfully, SwiftUI
    /// updates the view to show content that you specify, which you
    /// create using the loaded image. For example, you can show a green
    /// placeholder, followed by a tiled version of the loaded image:
    ///
    ///     AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/icon.png")) { image in
    ///         image.resizable(resizingMode: .tile)

    ///         Color.green
    ///     }

    /// placeholder. To be able to display a different view on a load error,
    /// use the ``init(url:scale:transaction:content:)`` initializer instead.

    ///   - content: A closure that takes the loaded image as an input, and
    ///     returns the view to show. You can return the image directly, or
    ///     modify it as needed before returning it.
    ///   - placeholder: A closure that returns the view to show until the

    ///
    /// If you set the asynchronous image's URL to `nil`, or after you set the
    /// URL to a value but before the load operation completes, the phase is
    /// ``AsyncImagePhase/empty``. After the operation completes, the phase
    /// becomes either ``AsyncImagePhase/failure(_:)`` or
    /// ``AsyncImagePhase/success(_:)``. In the first case, the phase's
    /// ``AsyncImagePhase/error`` value indicates the reason for failure.
    /// In the second case, the phase's ``AsyncImagePhase/image`` property
    /// contains the loaded image. Use the phase to drive the output of the
    /// `content` closure, which defines the view's appearance:
    ///
    ///     AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/icon.png")) { phase in
