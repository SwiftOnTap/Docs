/// An object that publishes its changes.
///
/// ### Understanding `ObservableObject`
///
/// The `ObservableObject` protocol definition is as follows:
/// ```
/// public protocol ObservableObject: AnyObject {
///     associatedtype ObjectWillChangePublisher: Publisher
///
///     var objectWillChange: ObjectWillChangePublisher { get }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `ObservableObject` has one simple requirement - the `objectWillChange`
/// publisher. The `objectWillChange` publisher is responsible for emitting just
/// before the object changes.
///
/// This requirement is fundamental to how the SwiftUI runtime interacts with
/// your object-based data models. It allows the runtime to react to changes
/// in your data, and queue view updates for the UI's next render cycle.
///
/// ### Using `ObservableObject`
///
/// To conform to `ObservableObject`, simply add it to the class definition.
///
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var foo: Bool = false
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `ObservableObject` provides a default implementation for `objectWillChange`
/// using `Combine/ObservableObjectPublisher`.
///
/// To trigger `objectWillChange` events when your data changes, annotate your
/// properties with the `@Published` property wrapper. Adding `@Published` to a
/// variable causes the object to emit an `objectWillChange` event any time that
/// variable is modified.
///
/// Note: This only works if you are using the default `ObservableObject`
/// implementation, or if `objectWillChange` is an instance of
/// `ObservableObjectPublisher`. If you use a custom `Publisher` type, you are
/// responsible for triggering updates yourself.
///
/// ### Manually triggering `objectWillChange`
///
/// You can also manually trigger updates by calling
/// `ObservableObjectPublisher/send()`.
///
/// This is useful for cases where `@Published` does not suffice. For example:
///
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     class ChildModel {
///         var foo: String = "Apple"
///     }
///
///     var childModel = ChildModel()
///
///     func updateChildModel() {
///         childModel.foo = "Banana"
///
///         objectWillChange.send()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, `AppModel` holds a reference to a child model,
/// `ChildModel`. Adding a `@Published` to the `childModel` variable would
/// have no effect because `ChildModel` is a class and not a value type.
/// Therefore, to emit a change event, you must manually call
/// `objectWillChange.send()` when updating the child model.
///
/// ### Using a custom publisher
///
/// In some cases, you may want to use a custom `Publisher` type for
/// `objectWillChange`. For example:
///
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     public let objectWillChange = PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This example uses a `Combine/PassthroughSubject` for its `objectWillChange`
/// requirement. A passthrough subject is a publisher that lets you send values
/// manually (i.e. "passes through" any values sent to it).
///
/// **Note:** The `@Published` property wrapper does not work with custom
/// publishers. If you use a custom publisher, you are responsible for updating
/// the object yourself. For example:
///
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     public let objectWillChange = PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>()
///
///     var foo: Bool = false {
///         willSet {
///             objectWillChange.send()
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Here `objectWillChange.send()` is manually called everytime `foo` is about
/// to update, using the `willSet` observer.
///
/// ### Using `ObservableObject` with SwiftUI
///
/// An observable object can be used to drive changes in a ``View``, via three
/// property wrapper types:
///
/// - `@ObservedObject`
/// - `@EnvironmentObject`
/// - `@StateObject`
///
/// #### Usage with `@StateObject`
///

/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var foo: Bool = false
/// }
///
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @StateObject var appModel = AppModel()
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Toggle("Foo", isOn: $appModel.foo)
///     }
/// }

/// the user with an **action sheet**.
///
/// ### What is an action sheet?
///
/// An ``ActionSheet`` is a modal alert that appears towards the bottom
/// of a user's screen. It provides **two or more** options
/// to the user based on the app context.
///
/// An `ActionSheet` is similar to an ``Alert``, but it appears at the bottom
/// of the screen instead of in the middle. To let the user respond
/// to the **state** of the app, use an ``Alert`` instead.
///
/// - Note: See Apple's
/// [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/action-sheets/)
/// for more about when to use action sheets.
///
/// ### Creating an action sheet
///
/// Creating an action sheet involves 3 components:
/// 1. A **title**, which is in bold font at the top of the sheet
/// 2. A **message**, which is optional, and appears under the title
/// 3. An **array of buttons**, which determine what the user can do from the
/// action sheet.
///
/// The buttons can take 3 styles: ``Alert/Button/cancel(_:action:)``
/// `Alert/Button/default(_:action:)`, and
/// ``Alert/Button/destructive(_:action:)``.
/// Check out ``Alert/Button`` for the full overview of action sheet buttons,
/// the available styles, and how to create them.
///
/// ### Using an action sheet
///
/// Once you have an action sheet, it is simple to use. Just pass
/// it as a trailing closure to the ``View/actionSheet(ispresented:content:)``
/// view modifier. The action sheet will be presented whenever
/// the `isPresented` binding parameter is `true`.
///
/// The following example passes an ``ActionSheet`` to this view modifier,
/// and illustrates the 3 different types of
/// action sheet buttons.
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @State private var showActionSheet = false
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Button("Eat 🍌") {
///             showActionSheet = true
///         }
///         .actionSheet(isPresented: $showActionSheet) {
///             ActionSheet(
///                 title: Text("Food alert!"),
///                 message: Text("You have made a selection"),
///                 buttons: [
///                     .cancel(),
///                     .destructive(Text("Change to 🍑") { /* override */ },
///                     .default(Text("Confirm")) { /* confirm */ }
///                 ]
///             )
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Notes:
/// - The system can override your button order. In the example above,
/// the cancel button is displayed last, because that is customary.
/// - If your action sheet requires a parameter, you can pass one in by
/// using the ``View/actionSheet(item:content:)`` view modifier instead.

/// An ``Alert`` is a modal-like presentation which contains a title, message, and

/// styling of alerts is semi-fixed, there are three available styles for the buttons to choose from:
/// ``Alert/Button/default(_:action:)``, ``Alert/Button/destructive(_:action:)``, and ``Alert/Button/cancel(_:action:)``. To actually present an alert, see
/// ``View/alert(isPresented:content:)``.
///
/// An alert can be created with one of two initializers, depending on if one button
/// or two is required. For example, to create an Alert with one button:
///

///                title: Text("An important title!"),

///            )
///        }
///    }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If the `dismissButton` value is left unspecified (as it was in this example),
/// it will default to a dismiss button with the text "Ok".
///

/// create a new ``Alert/Button`` instance and pass it in as a part of the initializer.
/// For example, to make an alert with a cancel and destructive button:
///

///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleAlertView: View {
///    @State private var showAlert = false

///            Alert(
///                title: Text("Are you sure?"),
///                message: Text("The following action will delete everything. Please confirm."),
///                primaryButton: Alert.Button.destructive(Text("Delete")),

///            )
///        }
///    }
/// }

///
/// For illustrative purposes, the alert button values used the expanded syntax in this example.
/// It is also valid to use the shorthand syntax when declaring alert buttons: `.default(_:action:)`,
/// `.cancel(_:)`, or `.destructive(_:action:)`
///
/// Notes:

///     - ``Angle/init(degrees:)``
///     - ``Angle/degrees(_:)``
///
/// See usage examples below.
///
/// ### Using an ``Angle`` with rotation
///
/// `Angles` are commonly used with the ``View/rotationEffect(_:anchor:)``
/// and similar modifiers:
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack(spacing: 50) {
///             Rectangle()
///                 .frame(width: 200, height: 100)
///                 .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: 15))
///                 .border(Color.orange)
///             Rectangle()
///                 .frame(width: 200, height: 100)
///                 .rotationEffect(.degrees(15))
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![Rectangle with rotation by angle](angle-rotation.png)
///
/// ### Using an ``Angle`` with drawing
///
/// ``Angle``s can also be used with drawing. Below, we define a custom
/// ``Shape`` called `Arc`, and make its parameter type ``Angle``. In our
/// ``View``, we pass 270 as the degrees parameter to specify the size of
/// the `Arc` to be displayed:
///
/// ```
/// struct Arc: Shape {
///     var endAngle: Angle
///
///     func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {
///         Path { p in

///                      startAngle: Angle.zero,
///                      endAngle: endAngle,
///                      clockwise: false)

/// ``Animatable`` describes how to animate a view with respect to some change in the view's data.
///
/// Use `Animatable` when you are unable to achieve the animation you want with ``View/animation(_:)`` or ``withAnimation(_:_:)``.
///
/// `Animatable` allows fine-grained control over the animation of a SwiftUI view's animatable values. It does so by requiring `animatableData: AnimatableData', which represents a view's animatable data.
///
/// By conforming to ``Animatable``, you are able to effectively **decouple** the animation of your view from the concept of *duration*, as you give SwiftUI the ability to interpolate arbitrarily between two different values for ``Animatable/animatableData-c6d9d``. This is also the reason why ``Animatable/animatableData`` must conform to ``VectorArithmetic``, which provides the runtime means to add, subtract and scale the animated values as necessary to generate data points for each frame of the animation over an arbitrary time interval.
/// [animatable-modifier ->]
/// ### Implementations
///
/// #### Using ``AnimatableModifier`` to implement a shake effect
///
/// `Animatable` is best used via `AnimatableModifier`, which is nothing but a simple protocol that combines `Animatable` and ``ViewModifier``. This allows you to decouple the animation effect from the view you want to animate.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var numberOfShakes: CGFloat = 0
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Text("Banana🍌🍌")
///                 .font(.largeTitle)
///                 .modifier(ShakeEffect(shakeNumber: numberOfShakes))
///                 .onAppear {
///                     withAnimation(.easeIn(duration: 2.0)) {
///                         numberOfShakes = 10
///                     }
///                 }
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct ShakeEffect: AnimatableModifier {
///     var shakeNumber: CGFloat = 0
///
///     var animatableData: CGFloat {
///         get {
///             shakeNumber
///         } set {
///             shakeNumber = newValue
///         }
///     }
///
///     func body(content: Content) -> some View {
///         content
///             .offset(x: sin(shakeNumber * .pi * 2) * 10)
///     }
/// }
/// ```

///
///
/// This example demonstrates a horizontal "shake effect", applied on a ``Text``. When run, the text animates by shaking 10 times. This is achieved by triggering an animation using ``withAnimation(_:_:)``, and modifying the `shakeNumber` to go from `0` to `10`.
///
/// Note:
///
/// - `shakeNumber` represents the *progress* of the animation. The SwiftUI runtime can set this value through ``Animatable/animatableData-c6d9d``, and it can be any value between the initial and the final value (`0.0` and `10.0` in this case).
///
/// - `shakeNumber` is a `CGFloat` and not an `Int`. This is because the runtime needs to be able to interpolate fractionally between `0.0` and `10.0` 'shakes' - and it does so by making use of `CGFloat`'s ``VectorArithmetic`` conformance.
///
/// - The exact mathematical function used to interpolate `shakeNumber` is determined by what type of ``Animation`` is used in ``withAnimation(_:_:)``, to animate the change from `0` shakes to `10` shakes.
///
/// #### Using ``AnimatableModifier`` to continuously animate a view along a circle
///
/// ``AnimatableModifier``, used with ``Animation/repeatForever(autoreverses:)`` can also be used to create a continuous animation.

///
/// In this example, `Text("Banana🍌🍌")` is animated along a circle continuously.
///
/// `CircleAnimation` is an implementation of an ``AnimatableModifier`` that uses a simple mathematical function to calculate the `x` and `y` offset of a view, given a radius and a progress value between `0.0` and `1.0`.
///
/// When the view appears, the `CircleAnimation` modifier is animated from a progress value of `0.0` to `1.0` using ``withAnimation(_:_:)``. The ``Animation`` used in ``withAnimation(_:_:)`` is modified using ``Animation/repeatForever(autoreverses:)``, in order to create a loop. Note that `autoreverses` is explicitly set as `false` to prevent the animation from being reversed.

/// Specifies the timing curve of a changing on-screen value.
///
/// ### An ``Animation`` is just a timing curve
///
/// Every animation has 3 parts:
///
/// 1. The numerical value in memory that changes over time --- usually
/// a `@``State property
/// 2. How the ``View`` depends on this numerical value --- often using
/// a view modifier
/// 3. The timing curve describing how this change happens --- this is the
/// ``Animation``
///
/// For example, say I want the screen to be **green** sometimes, but **red**
/// at other times. The current color of the screen would be stored as a
/// `@``State property. Then, the screen might use the
/// ``View/foregroundColor(_:)`` modifier to actually make the screen this
/// color. And finally, when I change the screen color, I can specify a
/// *timing curve*, or ``Animation``, to describe how it will happen.
///
/// ### Types of timing curves
///
/// There are many different types of timing curves, or ``Animations``.
/// For example, how long does the animation last (**duration**)? Does it move
/// at the same speed the whole time (**linear**), or does it **ease in and out**?
/// Or maybe it goes so fast at the beginning that it actually overshoots
/// the target and has to go back. This is called a **spring** animation.
///
/// #### Main types
///
/// There are a few main types of timing curves:
/// - ``Animation/linear``: The value changes at the same speed the whole time.
/// - ``Animation/easeIn``: The value begins by changing slowly, then speeds
/// up towards the end.
/// - ``Animation/easeOut``: The value begins quickly, and slows down towards
/// the end.
/// - ``Animation/easeInOut``: THe value begins by changing slowly, goes quickly
/// in the middle, and ends slowly.
/// - ``Animation/spring(response:dampingFraction:blendDuration:)``: The value begins very quickly, then overshoots
/// the target and springs back.
///
/// #### Modifiers
///
/// There are also a few modifiers that can be applied to timing curves:
/// - ``Animation/delay(_:)``: Waits a period of time before doing the
/// animation.
/// - ``Animation/speed(_:)``: Speeds up or slows down the animation.
/// - ``Animation/repeatCount(_:autoreverses:)``: Repeats the animation a number of
/// times.
/// - ``Animation/repeatForever(autoreverses:)``: Repeats the animation
/// forever
///
/// ### Using an animation
///
/// Once you have an animation, there are 3 main ways to use it:
///
/// 1. By applying it to a view using ``View/animation(_:)``,
/// so any animatable properties of the view change with that
/// timing curve.
/// 2. Directly when changing a `@``State` property, using the
/// ``withAnimation(_:_:)`` global function.
/// 3. By attaching the timing curve directly to a `@``Binding` property,
/// using ``Binding/animation(_:)``, so any changes to the binding happen
/// with a certain animation.
///
/// See each of those respective pages for specifics of how to use each.
///
/// ### Putting it all together
///
/// Putting all of the sections above together into one example, here
/// is what it looks like:
///

/// A transition to use for animating a view on and off the screen.

/// Use this structure along with the ``View/transition(_:)``

/// A transition is only one half of animating a view. You also must specify
/// a timing curve, (somewhat confusingly) called an "animation."
/// See ``Animation`` for more info on creating one of these timing curves.
///
/// ### Creating a transition
///
/// The easiest way to creat a transition is using one of
/// the many pre-made static members available in ``AnyTransition``.
/// See the sliding banana example at the bottom of this page.
///
/// You can also create your own static members by extending this
/// struct.
///
/// ```

///         return AnyTransition.slide.combined(with: .opacity)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Using a transition
///
/// Transitions are most often used by attaching them to views that have
/// "if" statements on them.
///
/// As long as a timing curve (``Animation``) is specified, whenever the
/// view is added to or removed from the screen, it will do so with
/// the specified transition.
///
/// There are many ways to add an animation to the transition:
/// - Using ``withAnimation(_:_:)``
/// - Using ``AnyTransition``'s own ``AnyTransition/animation(_:)`` modifier.
/// - Using ``View``'s ``View/animation(_:)`` modifier.
///
/// The following example applies the ``AnyTransition/slide`` transition:
///

/// This type handles shared values across views.
///
/// ``Binding`` is a property wrapper that creates a connection between stored data, and a view that displays and changes that data. It is a **two-way connection** to a source of truth. It is used to both read the latest value, as well as to set a new value. ``Binding`` defines a **getter** and a **setter** for a value.
///
/// ### Structure of a ``Binding``
///
/// A ``Binding`` is essentially the following structure:
///
/// ```
/// struct Binding<Value> {
///     let get: () -> Value
///     let set: (Value) -> ()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Creating a ``Binding`` from `@State `
///
/// A ``Binding`` typically represents a reference to a mutable source of truth - such as `@State`, `@ObservedObject` or a reference-writable keypath of an object. To create a ``Binding`` from a mutable source of truth, prefix the variable name for the source of truth with a dollar sign (`$`).
///
/// For example, a ``TextField`` can be bound to a state variable:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var text: String = "🍌🍌"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Text(text)
///         TextField("Placeholder", text: $text)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![Binding Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Binding-example-1.gif)
///
/// In the example above, the source of truth is a `@State` variable, named
/// `text`. `text`  represents a `String`, whereas `$text` represents a
/// `Binding<String>`. `TextField`'s initializer accepts a placeholder
/// `String` and a `Binding<String>`. In this example, `TextField` requires a
/// `Binding` to the source of truth as `TextField` must be able to *write back*
///  to the `@State` variable (a **mutable** source of truth).
///
/// Recall, a `Binding` is a **two-way connection** to a source of truth.
/// It is used to both read the latest value, as well as to set a new value.
/// In the previous example, the view's initial render will display an editable
/// text of "🍌🍌" on the screen - `TextField` reads the current value of the
/// source of truth `text` via the  `Binding` `$text`. When the user starts
/// editing, `TextField` *writes back* new values to the source of truth `text`
/// via the `Binding` `$text` once again.
///
/// ### Creating a ``Binding`` from an `ObservableObject`
///
/// In this example, the source of truth is an observable object `ExampleModel` - stored in a `@StateObject` owned by `ExampleView`:
///
/// ![Binding Example 2](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Binding-example-2.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @StateObject var viewModel = ExampleModel()
///
///     var text: String {
///         viewModel.isEnabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled"
///     }
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Toggle(text, isOn: $viewModel.isEnabled)
///     }
/// }
///
/// class ExampleModel: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var isEnabled: Bool = false
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The binding between the model's `isEnabled` variable and a toggle is established using `$viewModel.isEnabled` within `ExampleView`'s body. Note that the dollar sign must prefix the **root** variable, even in the case where a child member is being referenced. `$viewModel.isEnabled` and `viewModel.$isEnabled` are **not** equivalent. The former creates a ``Binding`` to `isEnabled`, whereas the latter unwraps the projected value of the `@Published` property wrapper wrapping `isEnabled`.
///
/// ### Animating Updates via a ``Binding``
///
/// Since a `Binding` is capable of updating a view's state, the state update can be made to animate with ``Binding/animation(_:)``. Usage looks as follows:
///
/// ```
/// $myVariable.animation(.default)
/// ```
///
/// ### Creating a ``Binding`` from a constant
///
/// At times, you may want to pass a fixed value as a `Binding`. This is possible via ``Binding/constant(_:)``, which creates a `Binding` to a fixed value, ignoring any updates from the consumer of the binding.
///
/// Consider `EnvironmentValues/editMode`, for example. A `List` can be forced into active editing by passing a binding to  `EditMode.active.
///
/// ![Binding Example 3](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Binding-example-3.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits = ["🍌", "🍏", "🍑"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             ForEach(fruits, id: \.self) { fruit in
///                 Text(fruit)
///             }
///             .onDelete { offets in
///                 fruits.remove(atOffsets: offets)
///             }
///         }
///         .environment(\.editMode, .constant(.active))
///     }
/// }

///             Button("Sign In", action: { /*sign the user in*/ })

///
/// The method of triggering the button varies by platform:
/// - In iOS and watchOS, the user triggers a standard button by tapping on it.
/// - In macOS, the user triggers a standard button by clicking on it.
/// - In tvOS, the user triggers a standard button by pressing "select" on an
///   external remote, like the Siri Remote, while focusing on the button.
///
/// ### Adding Buttons to Containers
///
/// Use buttons for any user interface element that triggers actions on press.
/// Buttons automatically adapt their visual style to match the expected style
/// within these different containers and contexts. For example, to create a
/// list cell that triggers an action when selected by the user, add a button to
/// the list's content. For example:
///
///     struct Item: Identifiable {
///         let id = UUID()
///         let title: String
///     }
///
///     struct ListView: View {
///         let items = [Item(title: "🍌"), Item(title: "🍑")]
///         var body: some View {
///             // A list of items, where the last row, when triggered,
///             // opens a UI for adding a new item.
///             List {
///                 ForEach(items) { item in
///                     Text(item.title)
///                 }
///                 Button("Add Item", action: { /* add item */ } )
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![Add Item List Cell](AddItem.png)
///
/// Similarly, to create a context menu item that triggers an action, add a
/// button to the menu's content:
///
///     struct ContextMenuView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("Press and hold for copy-paste options")
///                 .contextMenu {
///                     Button("Cut", action: { /* cut */ } )
///                     Button("Copy", action: { /* copy */ } )
///                     Button("Paste", action: { /* paste */ } )
///                 }
///         }
///     }
///
///![Button Example 4](press-and-hold-example.gif)
///
/// This pattern extends to most other container views in SwiftUI that have
/// customizable, interactive content, like forms (instances of ``Form``).
///
/// ### Styling Buttons
///
/// You can customize a button's appearance and interaction behavior. To add a
/// custom appearance with standard interaction behavior, create a style that
/// conforms to the ``ButtonStyle`` protocol. To customize both appearance and
/// interaction behavior, create a style that conforms to the
/// ``PrimitiveButtonStyle`` protocol. To set a specific style for all button
/// instances within a view, use the ``View/buttonStyle(_:)-3c92f`` modifier:
///
///     struct ButtonView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             HStack {
///                 Button("Sign In", action: { /* sign in */ } )
///                 Button("Register", action: { /* register */ } )
///             }

/// An interface to easily perform drag & drop operations.
///
/// The ``DropDelegate`` protocol offers functionality to customize drag and drop behaviors. It is preffered over ``View/onDrop(of:isTargeted:perform)`` view modifier when your drop behavior requires non-standard implementations.
///
/// ``DropDelegate`` heavily utalizes `NSItemProvider`, which provides information about the dragged data.
///
/// ### Setup
/// ``DropDelegate`` has one required implementation and four optional implementations.
///
/// Required:
/// - ``DropDelegate/performDrop(info:)`` specifies the behavior for your drop.
///
/// Optional:
/// - ``DropDelegate/validateDrop(info:)-954f7`` validates if a drop can be made.
/// - ``DropDelegate/dropEntered(info:)-525fa`` provides custom behavior when an object is dragged over the `onDrop` view.
/// - ``DropDelegate/dropExited(info:)-3d540`` provides custom behavior when an object is dragged off of the `onDrop` view.
/// - ``DropDelegate/dropUpdated(info:)-72cd3`` provides custom behavior when the drop is updated.
///
/// ### Creating a simple Drag & Drop
/// #### Create a draggable ``View``
/// Make a view draggable with the ``View/.onDrag(_:)`` modifier.
///
/// Use `NSItemProvider` to define the specific data dragged from that view.
///
/// ```
/// //  Text to drag
/// Text(text)
///     .font(.title)
///     .onDrag{ return NSItemProvider(object: "🍌🍌" as NSString) }
/// ```
///
/// #### Creating a drop ``View``
/// Use `onDrop` to create a view that accepts "drops" from dragged data. There are three versions of the `onDrop` modifier:
///
/// - `View/onDrop(of:isTargeted:perform)-bae65` is the simplest implementation. Specify a closure to execute when content is dropped.
/// - `View/onDrop(of:isTargeted:perform)-55379` is similar to the former, but the closure also provides information about the drop location.
/// - `View/onDrop(of:delegate)-a3cfb` requires a ``DropDelegate`` and is the most versatile.
///

/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var text: String = "🍌🍌"

///             //  Text to drag
///             Text(text)
///                 .font(.title)
///                 .onDrag{ return NSItemProvider(object: self.text as NSItemProviderWriting) }
///
///             //  Area to drop
///             RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10)
///                 .frame(width: 150, height: 150)
///                 .onDrop(of: ["text"], isTargeted: nil, perform: { _ in

/// Implement `DropDelegate/performDrop(info:)` to create a structure that conforms to ``DropDelegate``.

///         self.text = "Dropped My Bananas 🍌🍌!"
///         return true
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Using ``DropInfo`` for custom logic
/// ``DropInfo`` provides information about the drop and is used to create custom drop behaviors.
///
/// For example, say your user drags & drops `NSString` data. Use the ``DropInfo/itemproviders(for:)-7f580`` to get an array of `NSItemProvider` data (recall all dragged data arrives in this format).
///
/// Next, use `NSItemProvider`'s property `loadItem` to extract an `NSSecureCoding` from your dragged data.
///
/// Finally, cast your `NSSecureCoding` data to the more Swift-friendly `Data` object. From here your program can decode that data into a string and run any custom behaviors from that string.
///
/// The view in the example below is conditionally colored depending on the dragged string.

/// ### Using environment objects
///
/// Consider the following example:
///
/// ![2B8CB1C2-A204-47A8-AF0D-95C69028ECAC](2B8CB1C2-A204-47A8-AF0D-95C69028ECAC.png)

///     let text: String = "some text"

///
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @StateObject var appModel = AppModel()
///
///     var body: some View {
///         ChildView()
///             .environmentObject(appModel)
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct ChildView: View {
///     @EnvironmentObject var appModel: AppModel
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Text(appModel.text)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - An app model, `AppModel` is initialized in a `@StateObject` in the `ContentView`.
/// - `ContentView` initializes `ChildView`, and then passes the app model initialized via ``View/environmentObject(_:)``.
/// - `ChildView` uses `AppModel` to display a piece of text declared by the app model.
/// [<-]
/// Now consider a slightly different version of this example:
///
/// ![6181BC35-A419-499C-B394-64E170CECAD1](6181BC35-A419-499C-B394-64E170CECAD1.png)
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     let text: String = "some text"
/// }
///
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @StateObject var appModel = AppModel()
///
///     var body: some View {
///         IntermediateView()
///             .environmentObject(appModel)
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct IntermediateView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ChildView()
///             .padding()
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct ChildView: View {
///     @EnvironmentObject var appModel: AppModel
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Text(appModel.text)
///     }
/// }
///
/// ```
///
/// In this example, `ChildView` is initialized by an `IntermediateView`, which in turn is initialized by `ContentView`. This example is different only in that there is an additional level of nesting, via `IntermediateView` (a view that adds padding to `ChildView`).
///
/// Note that `ChildView` did not need to be changed at all. `@EnvironmentObject` is neither used nor declared in `IntermediateView`, yet it is still available in the same way at one level deeper.
///
/// This is also the primary way in which `@EnvironmentObject` and `@ObservedObject` differ. Had `ChildView` been using `@ObservedObject`, the app model would need to be passed explicitly through `IntermediateView`, which would also need to declare `var appModel: AppModel` and then pass it to `ChildView`'s initializer.
///
/// ### Creating bindings
///
/// Here is another example:
///
/// ![5BADAB08-D42D-4FF2-9174-06C29CB15738](5BADAB08-D42D-4FF2-9174-06C29CB15738.png)
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var flag: Bool = false
/// }
///
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @StateObject var appModel = AppModel()
///
///     var body: some View {
///         ChildView()
///             .environmentObject(appModel)
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct ChildView: View {
///     @EnvironmentObject var appModel: AppModel
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Toggle("Flag", isOn: $appModel.flag)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
///  In this example, `AppModel` contains a boolean, `flag`, which is represented by a ``Toggle`` in `ChildView`. ``Toggle`` requires a `Binding<Bool>` to read and write whether it is on.
///
/// Just like `@State`, `@ObservedObject` and `@StateObject`, `@EnvironmentObject` allows you to create a ``Binding`` from its wrapped value type using the `$` syntax.
///
/// `$appModel.flag` creates a binding to `flag`, which is then passed to the toggle. This is also a good example of how **mutable** data can be passed down from a parent view to a child view (at any level deep) at runtime.
///
/// ### Dependency injection
///
/// Because `@EnvironmentObject` receives the object from the environment, the object can be passed down any number of levels. This makes it especially useful for problems such as dependency injection.
///
/// There are many use cases of `@EnvironmentObject` that don't necessarily involve passing the app's main model down. For example:
///
/// - Providing a "theme" object, allowing child views to adapt as per the theme passed down.
/// - Providing a cache, that allows complex network-based views to be broken down into reusable components, while still using a cache provided by the parent.
/// - Passing a global navigation manager - a navigator object that contains the current navigation selection.
///
/// ### Caveats
///
/// There are some limitations to `@EnvironmentObject`, especially on older versions of iOS.
///
/// On iOS 13, environment objects do not automatically pass to sheets or navigation destinations. The following code would crash on iOS 13, for example:
///
/// ![CA7BCD70-C1A2-49F4-A005-36055F937FFF](CA7BCD70-C1A2-49F4-A005-36055F937FFF.png)

/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var flag: Bool = false
/// }
///
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @StateObject var appModel = AppModel()
///
///     @State var isPresented: Bool = false
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Button("Present") {
///             isPresented = true
///         }
///         .sheet(isPresented: $isPresented ){

///     var body: some View {
///         Toggle("Flag", isOn: $appModel.flag)
///     }

/// To fix it, the ``View/environmentObject(_:)`` modifier would need to be added directly to the sheet's content, like this:

///
///     @Environment(\.locale) var locale: Locale
///
/// Use the property you declare to dynamically control a view's layout.

/// `EnvironmentValues/pixelLength`, ``EnvironmentValues/scenePhase``, or
/// ``EnvironmentValues/locale``, based on device characteristics, system state,

/// provides a reasonable default value.

/// You can set or override some values using the ``View/environment(_:_:)``

///     MyView()
///         .environment(\.lineLimit, 2)

/// The value that you set affects the environment for the view that you modify

///
///     MyView()
///         .lineLimit(2)
///
/// In some cases, using a dedicated view modifier provides additional
/// functionality. For example, you must use the
/// ``View/preferredColorScheme(_:)`` modifier rather than setting
/// ``EnvironmentValues/colorScheme`` directly to ensure that the new
/// value propagates up to the presenting container when presenting a view

/// - `class` --> ``ReferenceFileDocument``
///
/// Don't worry about thread safety when using ``ReferenceFileDocument``, since

///
/// - Note: If your app will have documents, it very likely will be easiest to begin from Apple's own
/// Document app template. To do this, go to `File > New > Project`, and then use `Document App`.

/// ```
/// struct GeometryReader<Content: View> {
///     var content: (GeometryProxy) -> Content
///
///     var body: some View {
///         content(<container geometry>)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the implementation above, `<container geometry>` is an instance of ``GeometryProxy``. ``GeometryProxy`` simply encapsulates the container's frame and safe area insets, provided at runtime by SwiftUI.
///
/// ### ``GeometryReader`` to get container bounds
///
/// In this example, ``GeometryReader`` is used to create a view scaled down to exactly half of its parent container:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         GeometryReader { (proxy: GeometryProxy) in
///             Color.green
///                 .frame(
///                     width: proxy.size.width / 2,
///                     height: proxy.size.height / 2
///                 )
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![GeometryReader Example 1](CA77AB4E-DB8C-453A-8A64-A86209607321.png)
///
/// Note: `GeometryReader` **fills into** its parent container, and the current default alignment of its content is `Alignment/topLeading`. The example above results in a green rectangle aligned to the top left corner of the screen, inset by the screen's safe area. The alignment cannot be overriden, and is liable to change in the future.
///
/// ### ``GeometryReader`` to get a view's frame
///
/// ``GeometryReader`` can also be used with`View/background(_:)`, to acquire the geometry of a target view. Consider `SomeView` in the following example:
///
/// ![6DEDD064-9A38-4714-9732-9C8D6F6D5715](6DEDD064-9A38-4714-9732-9C8D6F6D5715.png)

///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Resizing Images
///
/// **Important:** The ``Image/resizable(capInsets:resizingMode:)`` modifier
/// must come first on an Image before making changes to its size in subsequent
/// modifiers.
///
/// The ``View/scaledToFit()`` modifier will lock the aspect ratio of the image
/// and scale it to the maximum size it can be without being too large for the
/// screen.
///
/// The ``View/scaledToFill()`` modifier also scales the image, but it does not
/// lock the aspect ratio and, subsequently, is likely to stretch or shrink the
/// image to fit the available space.
///
/// ### Using system icon images
///
/// SF Symbols is a library of over 1500 symbols that Apple provides in nine
/// weights from ultralight to black. To use these in custom images, simply
/// use the ``Image/init(systemName:)`` initializer.
///
/// ![1285236D-2F00-4099-8A5A-3CC5E76A5000](1285236D-2F00-4099-8A5A-3CC5E76A5000.png)

///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Creating a ``Link`` with a View
/// [[link-view]]
///
/// ### Background on ``Link`` in SwiftUI
///
///  Before Link was added to SwiftUI, there was no way equivalent of a hyperlink outside of a WKWebView.
///
/// It was possible to create a button with blue text that opens a URL, but this requires the logic to be added manually each time. For example:
///
///  ```
///  if URL(string: urlString) != nil {
///    //The old way to create a Link-style Button
///    Button("Read more") {
///      if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
///        UIApplication.shared.open(url, options: [:], completionHandler: {_ in })
///      }
///    }
///  } else {
///      EmptyView()
///          .onAppear { assertionFailure("URL was nil") }
///      }
///  }
///     ```
///
///  In iOS 14 there is the option of Link, which does the action part of the Button above for us. Apple’s documentation unsafely unwraps a URL using the ‘!’ operator, but this is bad practice. You may know that this particular URL is created successfully because it links to example.com/TOS.html, a site owned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) that convert URLs to IP addresses. But it's a mistake to assume that a URL string is valid and force unwrap the optional.
///
///  This example is held back by the lack of optional binding (if let or guard let) in the first version of SwiftUI, as it is instead restricted to comparing the URL to nil to ensure it exists. When this comparison confirms that the URL is not nil, this still doesn’t mean I can use it in the Button without unwrapping it first. This is why there is a slightly confusing additional step in the Button action, which optionally binds the URL to ensure that it is not nil.
///
///  The assertionFailure could have been in an else statement after the if let in the Button action, but the EmptyView has been added for consistency with the above Link example. An else statement containing EmptyView is not required, as any if statement around the only occupant of a ViewBuilder closure will return EmptyView when the if condition is false. If the URL was nil the user would see nothing, but an assertion would be triggered for the developer in debug mode.
///
///  This would allow us to be aware that the URL was nil, but without causing a crash for the end-user.
///
/// With updates to SwiftUI, the old code would roughly translate to the code below:
///
/// ![Link](/link.gif)
///
///     struct ExampleView: View {
///
///         let urlString = "https://swiftontap.com"
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Group {
///                 if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
///                     // The new way to create a Link
///                     Link("View SwiftOnTap", destination: url)
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
///  Now that SwiftUI supports if let, it is possible to directly create properties like the URL and create Views that use that data. Just as before, the link is only shown when the URL can be created, but it is not necessary to do multiple checks just to make sure that this is the case.

/// This is different from the previous example, because this initializer accepts a `rowContent` parameter that allows the `List` to generate SwiftUI views for the list's rows on-demand.
///
/// The `id` parameter requires a key-path to the *identifier* for each row of the ``List``. This is required so that ``List`` can efficiently process changes in the data source (in this example, the array `fruits`). These changes to the data source are animated as insertions, removals and reorders - reflecting the changes in the source.
///
/// It is up to the programmer to decide what property best represents the 'identiifer' of a particular type. In this example, the `String` itself is a valid identifier for the data, therefore `\.self` is passed along to the `id` parameter.
///
/// ### Creating a ``List`` with both fixed and dynamic elements
///
/// `List` allows you to mix both fixed and dynamic elements using ``ForEach``.
///
/// The following example displays a ``List`` of a fixed element ("Hello, World!") followed by dynamic elements from the previous example (using the `fruits` array):
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits: [String] = ["Bananas 🍌🍌", "Apples 🍏🍏", "Peaches 🍑🍑"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             Text("Hello, World!")

///
/// ![List Example 3](2D10DFE0-3A9D-4AD6-B7C3-A350EC37D0C4.png)
///
/// As seen in the above example, `ForEach` also accepts an `id` parameter along with a `rowContent`.
/// [list-sections ->]
/// ### Adding sections to a ``List``
///
/// The following example demonstrates the usage of ``Section``.
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits: [String] = ["Bananas 🍌🍌", "Apples 🍏🍏", "Peaches 🍑🍑"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             Section(header: Text("Not a fruit")) {
///                 Text("Hello, World!")
///             }

///             Section(header: Text("Fruit")) {
///                 ForEach(fruits, id: \.self) { (fruit: String) in
///                     Text(fruit)
///                 }

///
/// ![List Example 4](0CAA80FC-BDA9-405A-8AB1-5ED8B0ECF92C.png)

/// A `Section` used within a `List` will render as a table-section containing the elements wrapped by that section. Just as for unsectioned elements, sections can hold both fixed and dynamic elements.
/// [<-]
/// [list-style ->]
/// ### Styling a ``List``
///
/// A `List` can be styled using the ``View/listStyle(_:)`` modifier.
///
/// The following example demonstrates how to style a `List` using the grouped-inset style:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///             Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///             Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///         }
///         .listStyle(InsetGroupedListStyle())
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![List Example 5](7FC84606-BB3F-41C2-BEC1-40346A413676.png)
///
/// SwiftUI offers various list styles:
///
/// - ``DefaultListStyle``
/// - ``GroupedListStyle``
/// - ``InsetGroupedListStyle``
/// - ``InsetListStyle``
/// - ``PlainListStyle``
/// - ``SidebarListStyle``
///
/// Note: List styles only modify the appearance of a ``List``. They do not affect the order or positioning of rows within the ``List``.
/// [<-]
/// [list-row-background ->]
/// ### Setting the background view for a list row
///
/// Use ``View/listRowBackground(_:)`` to set the background view for a given row.
///
/// The following example demonstrates how ``View/listRowBackground(_:)`` can be used to provide specific background colors for a list's rows:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 .listRowBackground(Color.yellow)
///             Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 .listRowBackground(Color.green)
///             Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///                 .listRowBackground(Color.orange)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![List Example 6](A6394785-F064-497F-A48B-7ED9DAA55452.png)
///
/// A background can be provided for multiple list rows at a time, by applying the `View/listRowBackground(_:)` modifier to `ForEach`.
///
/// In the following example, all the rows of the ``List`` have the background view `Color.yellow`.

/// To make the text in your app appear as many different languages

///
/// Essentially the way localization works is that rather than using
/// strings directly throughout your app, you use this structure instead.
/// This lets you look up string keys which are translated to all
/// the app's supported languages in a .strings file.
///
/// To learn about creating this file and the process of setting up

/// - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58578341/how-to-implement-localization-in-swift-ui)
///
/// ### Creating a localized string key
///
/// The most straightforward way to create a localized string key is
/// using its initializer:
///
///     let hello = LocalizedStringKey("Hello")
///
/// You can also create a localized string key from a string literal,
/// but you must specify the type explicitly or else it will be
/// interpreted as a ``String``:
///
///     let hello1 = "Hello" //Type String
///     let hello2: LocalizedStringKey = "Hello" //Type LocalizedStringKey
///
/// ### Using a localized string key
///
/// Many views in SwiftUI, like ``Button`` and ``Text``
/// accept localized string keys directly through their initializers by default.
///
///     struct UsingLocalizationView: View {
///         let text: LocalizedStringKey = "Hello"
///         var body: some View {
///             Button(text) { }
///             Text(text)
///         }
///     }
///
/// Also, since SwiftUI is localization-first, if you pass a string literal
/// to these initializers, they will be interpreted as localized string keys!
///
///     struct WithStringLiteralView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("This gets localized!")
///         }
///     }
///
/// However, if your variable is already a string, the intializer will
/// not localize the string:
///
///     struct RightAndWrongView: View {
///         let s = "Hello"
///         var body: some View {
///             Text(s) //Not localized
///             Text("Hello") //Localized!
///         }

/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {

/// [navigation-bar-hidden ->]
/// ### Hiding the navigation bar
///
/// The navigation bar is on by default within a `NavigationView`. It can be hidden using ``View/navigationBarHidden(_:)``.

/// ### Adding navigation bar items
///
/// Use ``View/navigationBarItems(leading:trailing:)`` to add items to a navigation bar's leading and trailing areas.

///             ) {
///                 Text("Apples")

/// A SwiftUI property wrapper that subscribes to an observable object.
///
/// - Like `@StateObject`, this type subscribes to the observable object and invalidates a view whenever the observable object changes.
/// - Unlike `@StateObject,` `@ObservedObject` does not persist the object in state. Objects are only *assigned* to `@ObservedObject`, they should be initialized and persistent by an ancestor view.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// In the following example, an observable object is assigned to an `@ObservedObject` variable:
///
/// ![FC1A678A-0513-408B-950E-5BE85697F297](FC1A678A-0513-408B-950E-5BE85697F297.png)
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     static let shared = AppModel()
///
///     @Published var fruitName: String = "Apple"
/// }
///
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @ObservedObject var appModel = AppModel.shared
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Text(appModel.fruitName)
///
///             Button("Change Text") {
///                 appModel.fruitName = "Banana"
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the example above, `ExampleView` will update its displayed text to "Banana" when the button labeled "Change Text" is pressed. This is because `ExampleView` has subscribed to `AppModel.shared` via the `@ObservedObject` `appModel` variable.
///
/// Whenever the object referenced by `appModel` (which is `AppModel.shared` in this case) emits a change, `ExampleView` will be invalidated and redrawn.
///
/// ### Creating bindings
///
/// Just like `@State`, `@EnvironmentObject` and `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject` allows you to create a ``Binding`` to an object using the `$` prefix syntax.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ![596F2956-1B74-4E8C-B60D-43550414B9F0](596F2956-1B74-4E8C-B60D-43550414B9F0.png)
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     static let shared = AppModel()
///
///     @Published var fruitName: String = "Apple"
/// }
///
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @ObservedObject var appModel = AppModel.shared
///
///     var body: some View {
///         TextField("Enter fruit name", text: $appModel.fruitName)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, a two-way connection is established between `appModel.fruitName` and ``TextField``, by using the `$` prefix to create a `Binding<String>`. This allows ``TextField`` to update the `fruitName` variable when the user enters text, and also to update its own displayed text if `fruitName` is changed programmatically.
///
/// ### Passing an observable object to a child view using `@ObservedObject`
///
/// Pass an observable object like you would pass any other variable down to a child view. For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @StateObject var appModel = AppModel()
///
///     struct ChildView: View {
///         @ObservedObject var appModel: AppModel
///
///         var body: some View {
///             TextField("Enter fruit name", text: $appModel.fruitName)
///         }
///     }
///
///     var body: some View {
///         ChildView(appModel: appModel)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It is a common pattern for a parent view to create a `@StateObject` to hold an observable object, and then to pass it down to a child using an `@ObservedObject`. `@StateObject` **owns** the object, `@ObservedObject` simply holds a reference to the object.
///
/// ### Comparison with `@StateObject`
///
/// Consider the following:
///

///             Text("The value is: \(String(describing: value))")
///         }

///     @State var foo = false

///         VStack {
///             ToggleDescription(value: foo)
///
///             Toggle("Refresh", isOn: $foo)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```

/// - `ID`: The type of the identifier for an element.
/// - `Parent`: The type of the visual representation of an element whose
///   children property is non-`nil`
/// - `Leaf`: The type of the visual representation of an element whose
///   children property is `nil`.
/// - `Subgroup`: A type of a view that groups a parent view and a view
///   representing its children, typically with some mechanism for showing and
///   hiding the children

/// ### Creating a path
///
/// There are 8 different ways to create a path:
///
///
///
/// 1. Empty path: ``Path/init()``
/// 2. Path from closure
/// 3. Path from `CGMutablePath`
/// 4. Path from `CGPath`
/// 5. Path from ``Rectangle``
/// 6. Path from `String`
/// 7. Path from ellipse:
/// ``Path/init(ellipseIn:)``
/// 8. Path from ``RoundedRectangle``:
/// ``Path/init(roundedRect:cornerSize:style:)`` or
/// ``Path/init(roundedRect:cornerRadius:style:)``
///
///
///
/// ### Modifying and mutating a path
///
/// Use mutating path methods in conjunction with the init-from-a-closure
/// path initializer to mutate the path before returning it. These methods
/// mutate and return the path.
///
/// Use non-mutating (modifying) path methods on already existing paths
/// similarly to view modifiers to update and return something new.
///
/// In the following example, `move(to:)` and `addLine(to:)` are
/// mutating methods, while `stroke()` is a non-mutating method.
///
/// ![75F56224-5C30-4AE3-B526-336907676D1E](75F56224-5C30-4AE3-B526-336907676D1E.png)

///
///
/// Set the `selection` parameter to a "current selection" binding.
///
/// Set the label to a view that describes the purpose of selecting content
/// in the picker.
///
/// The content is what the picker displays.
///
/// For example, consider the following enumeration of ice cream flavors:
///
///     enum Flavor: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
///         case chocolate
///         case vanilla
///         case strawberry
///
///         var id: String { self.rawValue }
///     }
///
/// You can create a picker to select among these values by providing ``Text``
/// views in the picker initializer's content:
///
/// ![Picker Ice Cream](/picker-ice-cream.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct IceCreamView: View {
///     @State private var selectedFlavor = Flavor.chocolate
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
///             Text("Chocolate 🍫")
///                 .tag(Flavor.chocolate)
///             Text("Vanilla 🍦")
///                 .tag(Flavor.vanilla)
///             Text("Strawberry 🍓")
///                 .tag(Flavor.strawberry)
///         }
///         Text("Selected flavor: \(selectedFlavor.rawValue)")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You append a tag to each text view so that the type of each selection
/// matches the type of the bound state variable.
///
/// ### Iterating Over a Picker’s Options
///
/// To provide selection values for the ``Picker`` without explicitly listing
/// each option, you can create the picker with a ``ForEach`` construct, like
/// this:
///
/// ```
/// struct IceCreamView: View {
///     @State private var selectedFlavor = Flavor.chocolate
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
///             ForEach(Flavor.allCases) { flavor in
///                 Text(flavor.rawValue.capitalized)
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this case, ``ForEach`` automatically assigns a tag to the selection
/// views, using each option's `id`, which it can do because `Flavor` conforms
/// to the [Identifiable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/identifiable)
/// protocol.
///
/// However, if the selection type doesn't match the input to the
/// ``ForEach``, you need to provide an explicit tag. The following example
/// shows a picker that has a binding to a `Topping` type, even though the options
/// are all `Flavor` instances. Each option uses ``View/tag(_:)`` to associate
/// a topping with the flavor it displays.
///
/// ![Picker Toppings](CD09FF20-8779-4064-ADB9-7335DD85C4E9.png)
///
/// ```
/// enum Flavor: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
///     case chocolate
///     case vanilla
///     case strawberry
///
///     var id: String { self.rawValue }
///     var suggestedTopping: Topping {
///         switch self {
///         case .chocolate:
///             return .nuts
///         case .vanilla:
///             return .cookies
///         case .strawberry:
///             return .blueberries
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// enum Topping: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
///     case nuts
///     case cookies
///     case blueberries
///
///     var id: String { self.rawValue }
/// }
///
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @State private var suggestedTopping: Topping = .cookies
///     var body: some View {
///         Picker("Suggest a topping for:", selection: $suggestedTopping) {
///             ForEach(Flavor.allCases) { flavor in
///                 Text(flavor.rawValue.capitalized)
///                     .tag(flavor.suggestedTopping)
///             }
///         }
///         Text("suggestedTopping: \(suggestedTopping.rawValue)")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Styling Pickers
///
/// You can customize the appearance and interaction of pickers by creating
/// styles that conform to the ``PickerStyle`` protocol. You create your own style
/// or use one of the styles provided by SwiftUI, like ``SegmentedPickerStyle``
/// or `PopUpButtonPickerStyle`.

/// To set a specific style for all picker instances within a view, use the

///   A vertical `ProgressView` can be achieved by rotating 90 degrees, but this will not make enough vertical space for it to display within the available space.

/// This protocol is very similar to ``FileDocument``, with the difference being whether the data
/// is stored as a `class` (reference type) or a ``struct`` (value type). Use the two protocols like this:
/// - ``struct`` --> ``FileDocument``
/// - `class` --> ``ReferenceFileDocument``
///
/// While the two protocols are similar, ``ReferenceFileDocument`` has the unique challenge
/// of the user editing a document while it is being written to a file. For this reason,
/// ``ReferenceFileDocument/snapshot`` must be used. See the example for more details.
///
/// Don't worry about thread safety when using ``ReferenceFileDocument``, since
/// deserialization and serialization are done on a background thread.
///
/// - Note: If your app will have documents, it very likely will be easiest to begin from Apple's own
/// Document app template. To do this, go to *File > New > Project*, and then use *Document App*.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// #### App structure
///
/// To begin, update the scene definition to use ``DocumentGroup``.
///
///     import SwiftUI
///
///     @main
///     struct ExampleApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             DocumentGroup(newDocument: { ExampleDocument() }) { file in
///                 ContentView(document: file.document)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// #### ReferenceFileDocument conformance
///
/// Next, conform to the ReferenceFileDocument protocol by implementing these properties:
/// - A: ``ReferenceFileDocument/readableContentTypes``
/// - B: ``ReferenceFileDocument/init(configuration:)``
/// - C: ``ReferenceFileDocument/fileWrapper(snapshot:configuration:)``
/// - D: ``ReferenceFileDocument/snapshot(contentType:)``
///
///     import SwiftUI
///     import UniformTypeIdentifiers
///
///     class ExampleDocument: ReferenceFileDocument {
///         @Published var text: String

///             self.text = text

///         func snapshot(contentType: UTType) throws -> String {
///             return text
///         }
///     }
///
/// #### View implementation
///
/// Finally, use the ``TextEditor`` view to edit the document file.
///
///     import SwiftUI
///
///     struct ExampleView: View {
///         @ObservedObject var document: ExampleDocument
///         var body: some View {
///             TextEditor(text: $document.text)
///         }
///     }
///
/// #### UTType settings
///
/// In order for any of this to work, your Xcode project will have to define a document type. To do this,
/// follow these steps:
///
///
///
/// 1. Go to the Xcode project settings.
/// 2. Click on your target to the left.
/// 3. Expand the "Document Types" tab.
/// 4. Click *"Click here to add additional document type properties"*
/// 5. Make the **Key** *NSUbiquitousDocumentUserActivityType*.
/// 6. Ensure the **Type** is *String*.
/// 7. Make the Value *$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER).example-document*.
/// 8. Change the **Types** (top right) to *com.example.plain-text*.
///
///
///
/// Lastly, in your *ExampleDocument.swift* file, extend `UTType`:
///
///     import SwiftUI
///     import UniformTypeIdentifiers
///
///     extension UTType {
///         static var exampleText: UTType {

///
/// Now, assume an element in your view is meant to correspond to an exact text size regardless of a user's `Dynamic Type` settings. This behavior can be achieved by initializing ``ScaledMetric`` relative to a ``Font/TextStyle``.

/// ### More
/// By default, font sizes scale with `Dynamic Types`. However, if your app declares a custom font size, it will not scale by default.
///
/// For example, the follow view will not scale when the user's font is set to large:
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("Banana 🍌")
///                 .font(.system(size: 34, weight: .bold, design: .rounded))
///         }
///     }
///
/// However, by setting a font size to a scaled value, the text will scale accordingly:
///
/// ![Font Example](scaledmetric-example-7.png)
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         @ScaledMetric(relativeTo: .largeTitle) var dynamicFontSize: CGFloat = 34
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("Banana 🍌")
///                 .font(.system(size: dynamicFontSize, weight: .bold, design: .rounded))

///         }
///     }
///
/// ![Scene Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Scene-example-1.png)
///
/// #### Using custom Scenes
///
/// Just like how custom ``View``s are made out of a `var body` of smaller  ``View``s,
/// custom ``Scene``s are made out of a `var body` of smaller ``Scene``s.
///
///     @main
///     struct MacCompatibleApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             CustomScene()
///         }
///
///     struct CustomScene: Scene {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 Text("This is a mac-compatible app! 💻")
///             }

///
/// ### Modifiers
///
/// Just like how ``View``s have a bunch of custom modifiers that work right out of the box,
/// ``Scene`` provides default implementations of many useful modifiers. These can be used to do things
/// like adding macOS commands, changing the toolbar, and adding support for app storage.
/// [scene-phase ->]
/// ### Getting Scene Status

/// A property wrapper that lets you build scenes declaratively.
///
/// ``SceneBuilder`` is used primary in the ``App`` structure in SwiftUI to let you create
/// your app's scenes by just listing them out in a trailing closure.
/// It's a **property wrapper** applied to function parameter.
/// Usually, it's just working behind the scenes, so you don't have to
/// worry about it.
///
/// (A scene builder is just specific type of
/// [result builder](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AdvancedOperators.html#ID630)
/// that you can use with ``Scene``s. Check out that link to learn
/// more about using these to write clean code.)
///
/// ### Using a ``SceneBuilder`` as a trailing closure
///
/// ``SceneBuilder`` works behind the scenes of many common SwiftUI
/// scenes - like ``WindowGroup`` and ``Settings``. For example, here
/// is the declaration of ``Group``'s initializer:
///
/// ```
/// public init(@SceneBuilder content: () -> Content) {
///     // Implementation here
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Since that parameter is a ``SceneBuilder``, you can easily create
/// a ``Group`` by passing it a [trailing closure](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html#ID102)
/// stacking views:
///
/// ```
/// @main
/// struct SampleApp: App {
///     var body: some Scene {
///         Group {
///             WindowGroup(id: "a") {
///                 Text("I'm in the group 😁")
///             }
///             WindowGroup(id: "b") {
///                 Text("Me too 🥂")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Using a ``SceneBuilder`` as a function
///
/// You can also use ``SceneBuilder`` as a function. Just tag your
/// function with `@SceneBuilder`, and use it just like you would with a
/// trailing closure:
///
/// ```
/// @main
/// struct SampleApp: App {
///     var body: some Scene {
///         Group(content: contentBuilder)
///     }
///
///     @SceneBuilder
///     func contentBuilder() -> some Scene {
///         WindowGroup(id: "a") {
///             Text("I'm in the group 😁")
///         }
///         WindowGroup(id: "b") {
///             Text("Me too 🥂")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Using a `SceneBuilder` in your own ``Scene``s
///
/// Exactly like ``Group``, you can also use `ScebeBuilder`s in your own custom
/// scenes. Just tag the parameter of your ``Scene``'s initializer with
/// `@SceneBuilder`, and anyone using your scene will be able to easily
/// pass you views just by listing them.
///
/// In the example below, we use this technique to create a special
/// type of ``Group`` that adds command-P to print bananas to everything.
/// Note that ``SceneBuilder``s
/// are actually functions, so in order to get the content they contain,
/// you have to call the function. Below, this is done with `content()`.
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         BananaPrintingGroup {
///             WindowGroup(id: "a") {
///                 Text("I print 🍌")
///             }
///             WindowGroup(id: "b") {
///                 Text("Hey same 🍌🍌🍌")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct BananaPrintingGroup<Content>: Scene where Content: Scene {
///     var scenes: Content
///
///     init(@ViewBuilder content: () -> Content) {
///         self.scenes = content()
///     }
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Group {
///             views.commands { PrintCommand() }
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct PrintCommand: Commands {
///     var body: some Commands {
///         CommandMenu("Print") {
///             Button("Print", action: { print("🍌") })
///                 .keyboardShortcut(KeyboardShortcut(KeyEquivalent("p"), modifiers: [.command]))
///         }

/// An indication of a scene's operational state.
///
/// [[scene-phase]]
///
/// ### More
///
/// The system moves your app's ``Scene`` instances through phases that reflect
/// a scene's operational state. You can trigger actions when the phase changes.
/// Read the current phase by observing the ``EnvironmentValues/scenePhase``
/// value in the ``Environment``:
///
///     @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
///
/// How you interpret the value depends on where it's read from.
/// If you read the phase from inside a ``View`` instance, you obtain a value
/// that reflects the phase of the scene that contains the view. The following
/// example uses the `SwiftUI/View/onChange(of:perform:)` method to enable
/// a timer whenever the enclosing scene enters the ``ScenePhase/active`` phase
/// and disable the timer when entering any other phase:
///
///     struct MyView: View {
///         @ObservedObject var model: DataModel
///         @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
///
///         var body: some View {
///             TimerView()
///                 .onChange(of: scenePhase) { phase in
///                     model.isTimerRunning = (phase == .active)
///                 }
///         }
///     }
///
/// If you read the phase from within an ``App`` instance, you obtain an
/// aggregate value that reflects the phases of all the scenes in your app. The
/// app reports a value of ``ScenePhase/active`` if any scene is active, or a
/// value of ``ScenePhase/inactive`` when no scenes are active. This includes
/// multiple scene instances created from a single scene declaration; for
/// example, from a ``WindowGroup``. When an app enters the
/// ``ScenePhase/background`` phase, expect the app to terminate soon after.
/// You can use that opportunity to free any resources:
///
///     @main
///     struct MyApp: App {
///         @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
///
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 MyRootView()
///             }
///             .onChange(of: scenePhase) { phase in
///                 if phase == .background {
///                     // Perform cleanup when all scenes within
///                     // MyApp go to the background.
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// If you read the phase from within a custom ``Scene`` instance, the value
/// similarly reflects an aggregation of all the scenes that make up the custom
/// scene:
///
///     struct MyScene: Scene {
///         @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
///
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 MyRootView()
///             }
///             .onChange(of: scenePhase) { phase in
///                 if phase == .background {
///                     // Perform cleanup when all scenes within
///                     // MyScene go to the background.

/// A view that scrolls.
///
/// A view that allows the scrolling of its contained views.
///
/// ### Making a view scrollable
///
/// ``ScrollView`` is a container view that makes its content scrollable. For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-1.gif)
///
/// In this example, the `VStack` containing the text is made scrollable by wrapping it in a `ScrollView`.
///
/// Note:
///
/// - The content of a ``ScrollView`` is scrollable regardless of whether all of it fits on screen or not.
/// - It is not possible to selectively disable the scrolling of a `ScrollView`, while allowing its content to remain interactive. A ``View/disabled(_:)`` attached to a `ScrollView` will disable both the scrolling and all the interaction with the content visible.
/// - A ``ScrollView``'s scrollable region is sized to fit the content view passed to the ``ScrollView``.
/// - ``ScrollView`` fits to occupy as much space as possible. It is important to distinguish between the actual bounds of the scroll view, and the bounds of the *content* of the ``ScrollView``.
/// [scrollview-axis ->]
/// ### Setting the direction of scrolling
///
/// The default scrolling direction of a ``ScrollView`` is **vertical**. ``ScrollView`` supports 3 types of scrolling:
///
/// - vertical
/// - horizontal
/// - both vertical and horizontal
///
/// To set a single allowed direction for a ``ScrollView``, specify the axis of direction in the initializer. For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView(.horizontal) {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///  ![ScrollView Example 2](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-2.gif)
///
/// [<-]
/// This example takes the previous example, and modifies it so that the ``ScrollView`` scrolls horizontally. This ``ScrollView`` will **not** scroll vertically, as an explict axis, `.horizontal`, has been specified.
///
/// To allow *both* directions of scrolling, pass the set of axes that you want to permit. For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView([.horizontal, .vertical]) {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 3](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-3.gif)
///
/// In this example, `ScrollView` can scroll both horizontally *and* vertically, because both axes have been specified explicitly.
/// [scrollview-hide-indicators ->]
/// ### Hiding the scroll view indicator
///
/// By default, a ``ScrollView``'s scroll indicator is visible upon user interaction.
///
/// Pass `false` to `ScrollView/showsIndicators` in `ScrollView/init(_:showsIndicators:content:)` to hide the scroll indicator(s). For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView(.horizontal, showsIndicators: false) {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 4](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-4.gif)
///
/// This `ScrollView` will never show a scroll indicator.
///
/// You do not need to specify an axis to use `ScrollView/showsIndicators`. For example:
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 5](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-5.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView(showsIndicators: false) {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This ``ScrollView``  hides its scroll indicator, with a default `.vertical` scroll direction.
/// [<-]
/// [scrollview-proxy ->]
/// ### Scrolling to an item
///
/// To programmatically scroll to a particular item in your `ScrollView`, use `ScrollViewProxy/scrollTo(_:anchor:)`. `ScrollViewProxy` is a type that allows you to control a `ScrollView`, and can be obtained using a ``ScrollViewReader``.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView {
///             ScrollViewReader { (proxy: ScrollViewProxy) in
///                 Button("Jump to #32") {
///                     proxy.scrollTo(32)
///                 }
///
///                 ForEach(1..<101) { number in
///                     Text("Item #\(number)")
///                         .id(number)
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 6](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-6.gif)
///
/// In this example, clicking the button reading "Jump to #32", will cause the `ScrollView` to scroll to the item with the ID of the value `32`. To assign an ID to a view, use `View/id(_:)` as is done inside the `ForEach`, for each element.
///
/// The call of `proxy.scrollTo(32)` causes the `ScrollView` to scroll to the text reading "Item #32", with that text centered vertically in the `ScrollView`'s bounds. To change the anchor of the finalled scrolled-to destination, specify an anchor via ``ScrollViewProxy/scrollTo(_:anchor:)``. For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView {
///             ScrollViewReader { (proxy: ScrollViewProxy) in
///                 Button("Jump to #32") {
///                     proxy.scrollTo(32, anchor: .top)
///                 }
///
///                 ForEach(1..<101) { number in
///                     Text("Item #\(number)")
///                         .id(number)
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 7](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-7.gif)
///
/// In this example, the `ScrollView` still scrolls to "Item #32", but this `Text` is seen at the top of the `ScrollView`, rather than it's vertical center. The `anchor` parameter uses a type, `UnitPoint`, to determine the relative alignment (relative to the scroll view's bounds) of the scrolled-to item.
///
/// [<-]
/// [scrollview-scrollto ->]
///
///  Add a transition to your ``ScrollViewProxy/scrollTo(_:anchor:)`` with `View/withAnimation(_:_:)`.  For example:
///
///  ```
///  struct ExampleView: View {
///      var body: some View {
///          ScrollView {
///              ScrollViewReader { (proxy: ScrollViewProxy) in
///                  Button("Jump to #32") {
///                     withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 60)) {
///                         proxy.scrollTo(32, anchor: .top)
///                     }
///                  }
///
///                  ForEach(1..<101) { number in
///                      Text("Item #\(number)")
///                          .id(number)

///         return Path(rect)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// For more info on how to create a path from a bounding rectangle,
/// check out the ``Path`` structure.
///
/// ### Using a pre-defined shape
///
/// In addition to the ability to create your own shape, there are also
/// many pre-defined shapes for you to use:
///
///
///
/// 1. ``Capsule``
/// 2. ``Circle``
/// 3. ``ContainerRelativeShape``
/// 4. ``Ellipse``
/// 5. ``OffsetShape``
/// 6. ``Path``
/// 7. ``Rectangle``
/// 8. ``RoundedRectangle``
///
///
///
/// Example usage would look like this:
///

/// A SwiftUI property wrapper that holds a state value.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// Modifying a `@State` variable causes the `body` of the view to be recomputed. For example:
///
/// ![AC409A5C-FFE1-499F-8C47-C62AEA3E4AE7](AC409A5C-FFE1-499F-8C47-C62AEA3E4AE7.png)
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var foo: String = "Apple"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Text(foo)
///
///             Button("Change Text") {
///                 foo = "Banana"
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, pressing the button labeled "Change Text" modifies the `foo` state variable. This causes `ExampleView`'s `body` to be recomputed by the SwiftUI runtime. This  new `body` is then queued for the next render cycle, upon which the view's display is updated on the screen.
///
/// Note:
///
/// - Recomputing the `body` is also frequently referred to as "invalidating the view".
/// - While all SwiftUI views are value types, the `@State` property wrapper creates a reference based storage managed by the SwiftUI runtime. This is why mutating a state variable does not require a mutating function.
///
/// ### Passing state down to a child view
///
/// Pass a state variable just as you would pass any other variable to a struct. For example:
///
/// ![C8500709-199E-43A7-A416-B97CF82F1151](C8500709-199E-43A7-A416-B97CF82F1151.png)
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     struct ChildView: View {
///         let text: String
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Text(text)
///         }
///     }
///
///     @State var foo: String = "Apple"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             ChildView(text: foo)
///
///             Button("Change Text") {
///                 foo = "Banana"
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, `foo` is passed to `ChildView` by initializer.
///
/// And exactly as in the previous example, when `foo` updates, so will the `body` of `ExampleView`. When the `body` of `ExampleView` is recomputed, a new instance of `ChildView` is created with the latest value of `foo` (which is now "Banana"). `ChildView` in turn computes its own `body`, which creates a `Text("Banana")`.
///
/// Everytime a ``View`` is invalidated, its `body` is recomputed. Everytime the body is recomputed, all the view's childrens' bodies are also recursively recomputed. Since SwiftUI views are value types, creating and destroying them repeatedly (even hundreds of times a second) does not impact the app's performance.
///
/// ### Passing a reference to the state
///
/// The previous example demonstrated how a state value could be passed from a view to its child. However, for the child to be able to actually modify the parent's state, the parent must pass a **binding** to its child. A binding is a read/write reference to the `@State` variable, and is represented via `SwiftUI/Binding`.
///
/// To create a binding to a state variable, prefix it with a dollar sign `$`. For example:
///
/// ![67E06F60-E76B-42A8-9A18-0503382F1533](67E06F60-E76B-42A8-9A18-0503382F1533.png)
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var text: String = "🍌🍌"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Text(text)
///         TextField("Placeholder", text: $text)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, `TextField` requires a binding in order to read and write to a given value. The `text` state variable is converted to a `Binding<String>` using the dollar sign prefix (`$text`), and then passed to ``Textfield`` via its initializer.
///
/// Note: The ``Binding`` type can also be used to create references to `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject` and `@StateObject`. It is not unique to `@State`, but rather a general structure that represents a reference to some source of truth.
///
/// ### Modifying a state variable outside of `body`
///
/// It's possible to modify a state variable outside of a view's `body`. For example:
///
/// ![8CFDCB91-F7DD-4AF6-B2FE-83FBC337002C](8CFDCB91-F7DD-4AF6-B2FE-83FBC337002C.png)
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @State var foo: String = "Apple"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Text(foo)
///
///             Button("Change Text", action: changeText)
///         }
///     }
///
///     func changeText() {
///         foo = "Banana"
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, the button labeled "Change text" calls the function `changeText`, which modifies `foo`.
///
/// Note:
///
/// - `changeText` is not a `mutating ` function. This is because the `@State` property wrapper internally uses a reference based storage managed by the SwiftUI runtime.
/// - Only access a state property from inside the view’s body, or from methods called by it.
/// - Declare state properties as private, to prevent outside code from accessing them.
/// - Although you should only access the state from inside the body, you can mutate it elsewhere including from any thread.

/// A SwiftUI property wrapper that instantiates and stores an observable object in state.
///
/// - Think of `@StateObject` as a combination of `@State` and `@ObservedObject`.
/// - Like `@ObservedObject`, this type subscribes to the observable object and invalidates a view whenever the observable object changes.
/// - Unlike `@ObservedObject`, `@StateObject` holds on to its value even when the view is invalidated and redrawn.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// In the following example, an observable object class `AppModel` is instantiated and stored in a `@StateObject`:
///
/// ![B96E266D-DFC6-40A9-B6C1-56C609F308D0](B96E266D-DFC6-40A9-B6C1-56C609F308D0.png)
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var foo: Bool = false
/// }
///
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @StateObject var appModel = AppModel()
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Text("Hello World")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### How it works
///
/// The following is the basic structure of a `@StateObject`:
///
/// ```
/// struct StateObject<ObjectType: ObservableObject>: DynamicProperty {
///     var wrappedValue: ObjectType { get }
///
///     init(wrappedValue thunk: @autoclosure @escaping () -> ObjectType)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It's important to note that the initializer takes an `@autoclosure` expression. This means that the following code is evaluated lazily:
///
/// ```
///     @StateObject var appModel = AppModel()
/// ```
///
/// `AppModel` is only initialized once per the lifetime of the `View`, `Scene` or ``App`` that contains the `@StateObject`. This is made possible by the `@autoclosure` annotation, that wraps the instantiation of the app model, `AppModel()`, into a lazy expression at compile time, `{ return AppModel() }`. This allows the `@StateObject` to call it appropriately as needed, which is once per its parent's lifetime.
///
/// ### Creating bindings
///
/// Just like `@State`, `@ObservedObject` and `@EnvironmentObject`, `@StateObject` allows you to create a ``Binding`` from its wrapped value type using the `$` syntax.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ![FACF7A60-5C80-42FE-B933-9A62D2A53DC5](FACF7A60-5C80-42FE-B933-9A62D2A53DC5.png)
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var flag: Bool = false
/// }
///
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @StateObject var appModel = AppModel()
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Toggle("Flag", isOn: $appModel.flag)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
///  In this example, `AppModel` contains a boolean, `flag`, which is represented by a ``Toggle`` in `ChildView`. ``Toggle`` requires a `Binding<Bool>` to read and write whether it is on.
///
/// ### Comparison with `@ObservedObject`
///
/// Consider the following:
///
/// ![D465C0A4-0042-47C8-9840-4E58837FD18F](D465C0A4-0042-47C8-9840-4E58837FD18F.png)
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
///         init() {
///             print("Initialized")
///         }
///     }
///
///     struct ToggleDescription: View {
///         let value: Bool
///
///         @StateObject var viewModel = ViewModel()
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("The value is: \(String(describing: value))")
///         }
///     }
///
///     @State var foo = false
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             ToggleDescription(value: foo)
///
///             Toggle("Refresh", isOn: $foo)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `ExampleView` creates a vertical stack of a ``Toggle``, and a view that describes the toggle, `ToggleDescription`.
///
/// `ToggleDescription` also contains a `ViewModel`, that is instantiated and held by `@StateObject`. The `ViewModel` prints on initialization. Run this code and observe that the following is printed:
///
/// ```
/// Initialized
/// ```
///
/// Flip the toggle twice. Note that even though `ToggleDescription` is refreshed, nothing is printed further.
///
/// Now consider the following:
///
/// ![E74A3E6E-9A49-41AC-AEDB-38849CAB5A4D](E74A3E6E-9A49-41AC-AEDB-38849CAB5A4D.png)
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
///         init() {
///             print("Initialized")
///         }
///     }
///
///     struct ToggleDescription: View {
///         let value: Bool
///
///         @ObservedObject var viewModel = ViewModel()
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("The value is: \(String(describing: value))")
///         }
///     }
///
///     @State var foo = false
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             ToggleDescription(value: foo)
///
///             Toggle("Refresh", isOn: $foo)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This example is identical to the previous example **except** for the fact that `@StateObject` has been replaced with `@ObservedObject`. Run this code now, and observe the following print again:
///
/// ```
/// Initialized
/// ```
///
/// Now flip the toggle twice. The console will print the following:
///
/// ```
/// Initialized
/// Initialized
/// ```
///
/// This highlights the fundamental difference between `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject`.
///
/// -  `@StateObject` instantiates and holds the object in state
/// -  `@ObservedObject` is *assigned* an object, and **does not** hold it in state
///
/// ### Usage with ``App``
///
/// `@StateObject` provides a great way to initialize global, application-wide models.
///
/// In the following example, a `@StateObject` is instantiated in `MyApp`, and passed down to `ExampleView` as an environment object.
///
/// ```
/// class AppModel: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var foo: Bool = false
/// }
///
/// @main
/// struct MyApp: App {
///     @StateObject var appModel = AppModel()
///
///     var body: some Scene {
///         WindowGroup {
///             ExampleView()
///                 .environmentObject(appModel)

///
/// In addition, two special kinds of ``Shape``s have their own methods
/// for adding strokes with custom styles:

///
///
/// 1. ``InsettableShape``: An insettable shape allows you to inset the shape
/// by half the stroke width, then apply the stroke, so that the final
/// result remains inside the original frame. To achieve this effect,
/// use one of these methods:
///
///
///
///     1. ``InsettableShape/strokeBorder(_:style:antialiased:)``
///     2. ``InsettableShape/strokeBorder(style:antialiased:)``
///
///
///
/// 2. ``Path``: A path is a special kind of customizable shape. Use path's
/// special stroking method, ``Path/strokedPath(_:)``, to return another path,
/// rather than a generic shape.

///
/// You create a text editor by adding a ``TextEditor`` instance to the

///             TextEditor(text: $fullText)

/// ### Styling a text editor
///
/// To style the text, use the standard view modifiers to configure a system
/// font, set a custom font, or change the color of the view's text.
///
/// In this example, the view renders the editor's text in gray with a
/// custom font:
///
///     struct TextEditingView: View {
///         @State private var fullText = "This is some editable text..."
///
///         var body: some View {
///             TextEditor(text: $fullText)
///                 .foregroundColor(Color.gray)
///                 .font(.custom("HelveticaNeue", size: 13))
///         }
///     }
///
/// If you want to change the spacing or font scaling aspects of the text, you
/// can use modifiers like ``View/lineLimit(_:)``,
/// `View/lineSpacing(_:)`, and ``View/minimumScaleFactor(_:)`` to configure
/// how the view displays text depending on the space constraints. For example,
/// here the ``View/lineSpacing(_:)`` modifier sets the spacing between lines
/// to 5 points:
///
///     struct TextEditingView: View {
///         @State private var fullText = "This is some editable text..."
///
///         var body: some View {
///             TextEditor(text: $fullText)
///                 .lineLimit(3)

/// into SwiftUI.
///
/// ### Setup
///
/// To conform to ``UIViewRepresentable``, you must implement four main lifecycle
/// functions:
/// 1. ``UIViewRepresentable/makeUIView(context:)``: Create and return an
/// instance of your
/// ``UIViewRepresentable/UIViewType`` here.
/// 2. ``UIViewRepresentable/updateUIView(_:context:)``: This is immediately
/// called *once*
/// after the call to ``UIViewRepresentable/makeUIView(context:)``, then called
/// whenever any state changes.
/// 3. `UIViewRepresentable/dismantleUIView(context:)-78ab4`: Upon
/// destruction of the parent container, this gets called.
/// (This is **optional**. A default implementation is provided.)
/// 4. ``UIViewRepresentable/makeCoordinator()-138cc``: This creates a
/// ``UIViewRepresentable/Coordinator`` for the view.
/// (This is also **optional**.)
///
/// ### Port a simple `UIView`
///
/// To port a simple UIKit view, `UIActivityIndicatorView`, you could use the
/// following setup:
///
/// ```
/// struct ActivityIndicator: UIViewRepresentable {
///     typealias Context = UIViewRepresentableContext<Self>
///     typealias UIViewType = UIActivityIndicatorView
///
///     let isAnimated: Bool
///
///     public func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UIViewType {
///         UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .medium) // create the instance of the view
///     }
///
///     public func updateUIView(_ uiView: UIViewType, context: Context) {
///         // Check if isAnimated is true, and if the view is inactive.
///         if isAnimated && !uiView.isAnimating {
///             uiView.startAnimating() // Animate
///         }
///
///         // Check if isAnimated is false, and if the view is active.
///         if !isAnimated && uiView.isAnimating {
///             uiView.stopAnimating() // Stop animating
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note:
/// - In ``UIViewRepresentable/updateUIView(_:context:)``, you must handle
/// `isAnimated` being either `true` or `false`.
/// - No redundant calls are made to `startAnimating` and `stopAnimating`.
/// Redundant calls are guarded against by checking whether
/// `uiView.isAnimating` is true or not. This is a general principle for
/// optimizing the performance of your ``UIViewRepresentable``.
///
/// Having implemented it as a `UViewRepresentable`, you could now use it in SwiftUI. For example:
///
/// ![UIViewRepresentable Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/UIViewRepresentable-example-1.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @State var isAnimating: Bool = false
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Toggle("Animating", isOn: $isAnimating)
///             ActivityIndicator(isAnimated: isAnimating)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, the `ActivityIndicator` from before is used and can be
/// toggled by passing a boolean to `ActivityIndicator.init(isAnimated:)`.
/// [uiviewrepresentable-context ->]
/// ### Context-aware ``UIViewRepresentable``s
///
/// SwiftUI heavily relies on the environment, by way of environment objects
/// (`View/environmentObject(_:)`) and environment values (`EnvironmentValues`).
/// Environment values are useful for creating intelligent
/// and context-aware UIKit ports.
///
/// For example, we can remove the `isAnimated` parameter from
/// `ActivityIndicator`, and use `isEnabled` from the environment instead
/// via `EnvironmentValues`'s ``EnvironmentValues/isEnabled``:
///
/// ```
/// struct ActivityIndicator: UIViewRepresentable {
///     typealias Context = UIViewRepresentableContext<Self>
///     typealias UIViewType = UIActivityIndicatorView
///
///     public func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UIViewType {
///         UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .medium)
///     }
///
///     public func updateUIView(_ uiView: UIViewType, context: Context) {
///         if context.environment.isEnabled && !uiView.isAnimating {
///             uiView.startAnimating()
///         }
///         if !context.environment.isEnabled && uiView.isAnimating {
///             uiView.stopAnimating()
///         }

/// This has the added advantage of being passed from any level at the top,
/// because environment values propagate down the view hierarchy.
///
/// The ``View/disabled(_:)`` modifier is responsible for modifying
/// ``EnvironmentValues/isEnabled``. The example usage must be updated to use
/// ``View/disabled(_:)`` instead of `isAnimated`:
///

/// struct ContentView: View {

///                 .disabled(!isAnimating)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Using ``View/disabled(_:)``, the activity indicator can now be made active or inactive.

/// The benefits of using the environment and context become apparent when multiple views are used together. For example:

///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {

///
/// A single `View/disabled(_:)` modifier on the ``VStack`` can now become

///
/// ### Implementing UIKit delegates for a ``UIViewRepresentable``
///
/// UIKit views often require **delegates** to communicate events and pass data
/// back and forth with their view controllers. Since SwiftUI is all about
/// modularity and componentization, there is no concept of a
/// *view controller*. ``UIViewRepresentable`` uses the concept of a *coordinator*
/// to port views reliant on the delegate pattern.
///
/// Learn more about **delegation** in Swift
/// [here](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/delegation-in-swift/).
///
/// For example, here is an example port of `UISearchBar`:
///
/// ```
/// struct SearchBar: UIViewRepresentable {
///     let placeholder: String
///     @Binding var text: String
///
///     func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {
///         // Create an instance of Coordinator
///         Coordinator(self)
///     }
///
///     func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UISearchBar {
///         let searchBar = UISearchBar(frame: .zero)
///
///         searchBar.placeholder = placeholder
///         searchBar.delegate = context.coordinator
///
///         return searchBar
///     }
///
///     func updateUIView(_ uiView: UISearchBar, context: Context) {
///         // Set the search bar's text to the value of the binding
///         uiView.text = text
///     }
///
///
///     class Coordinator: NSObject, UISearchBarDelegate {
///         var parent: SearchBar
///
///         init(_ searchBar: SearchBar) {
///             parent = searchBar
///         }
///
///         func searchBar(_ searchBar: UISearchBar, textDidChange searchText: String) {
///             // Set the binding's value to the latest search bar text
///             parent.text = searchText
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A search bar is a good example of a complex UIKit view. It is a control
/// responsible for text input with multiple lifecycle events, and it uses
/// the delegate pattern to inform the observer whenever these events occur.
/// In SwiftUI, data is passed using bindings, and there is no concept of a
/// delegate.
///
/// The ``UIViewRepresentable/Coordinator`` is the glue between a
/// SwiftUI-style binding-pattern and a UIKit-style delegate-pattern.
/// A ``UIViewRepresentable/Coordinator`` is a state object created and maintained
/// for the lifetime of a ``UIViewRepresentable``, that typically implements the
/// primary delegate for the UIKit view being ported. In this case, the
/// `UIViewType` is `UISearchBar` and its primary delegate type is
/// `UISearchBarDelegate`.
///
/// Text input controls in SwiftUI often take a `String` ``Binding`` in their
/// initializer, and use it to get/set the latest text entered by the user
/// via control. It's extremely important to note that bindings are
/// bidirectional, because SwiftUI ports of UIKit views must also **get** the
/// latest input from the ``Binding``. UIKit patterns typically only require
/// notifying the observer and thus setting the values, but in SwiftUI it is
/// imperative to handle both to be a good SwiftUI citizen.
///
/// Here is example of using the search part port:
///
/// ![UIViewRepresentable Example 4](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/UIViewRepresentable-example-4.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @State var searchText: String = ""
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             SearchBar(placeholder: "Enter something here", text: $searchText)
///             Text("Entered text: \(searchText)")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, `SearchBar` is bound to a state variable, `searchText`.
/// To confirm that values are being written as they are input, a ``Text``
/// reflects the latest value of the state variable.
///
/// **Note** that if `searchText`'s initial value is used to set the initial
/// text of the` UISearchBar` represented by `SearchBar`. This means if the
/// initial value of `searchText` was set to `"Bananas 🍌🍌"`, `SearchBar`'
/// would have an initial search text of `"Bananas 🍌🍌"` already loaded.
///
/// ### Further notes
///
/// - Creating UIKit views are expensive. That is why they are done once per
/// lifetime of a ``UIViewRepresentable``.
/// - Because the *same* `UIViewType` instance is reused as much as possible,
/// ``UIViewRepresentable/updateUIView(_:context:)`` is responsible for making
/// sure that the parameters passed via the initializer, and the SwiftUI
/// environment, are always in sync with the UIKit view being managed by the
/// representable.

/// property to provide the content for your custom view.
///
///     struct MyView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("Hello, World!")
///         }
///     }
///
/// Assemble the view's body by combining one or more of the primitive views
/// provided by SwiftUI, like the ``Text`` instance in the example above, plus
/// other custom views that you define, into a hierarchy of views.
///
/// The ``View`` protocol provides a large set of modifiers, defined as protocol
/// methods with default implementations, that you use to position and configure
/// views in the layout of your app. Modifiers typically work by wrapping the
/// view instance on which you call them in another view with the specified
/// characteristics. For example, adding the ``View/opacity(_:)`` modifier to a
/// text view returns a new view with some amount of transparency:
///
///     Text("Hello, World!")
///         .opacity(0.5) // Display partially transparent text.
///
/// The effects of a modifier typically propagate to any child views that don't
/// explicitly override the modifier. For example, a ``VStack`` instance on its
/// own acts only to vertically stack other views, and has no text to display.
/// Therefore, a ``View/font(_:)`` modifier that you apply to the stack has no
/// effect on the stack itself. Yet the font modifier does apply to any of the
/// stack's child views, some of which might display text. On the other hand,
/// you can locally override the stack's modifier by adding another to a
/// specific child view:
///
///     VStack {
///         Text("Title")
///             .font(.headline) // Override the font of this one view.
///         Text("First body line.")
///         Text("Second body line.")
///     }
///     .font(.body) // Set a default for text in the stack.
///
/// You commonly chain modifiers, each wrapping the result of the previous one.
/// For example, you can wrap a text view in an invisible box with a given width
/// using the ``View/frame(width:height:alignment:)`` modifier to influence its
/// layout, and then use the ``View/border(_:width:)`` modifier to draw an
/// outline around that:
///
///     Text("Title")
///         .frame(width: 100)
///         .border(Color.gray)
///
/// The order in which you apply modifiers matters. For example, the border that
/// results from the above code outlines the full width of the frame.
///
/// ![A screenshot of a text view displaying the string "Title", outlined by a
/// gray rectangle that's wider than the string it encloses, leaving empty space
/// inside the rectangle on either side of the string. A caption reads, "Apply
/// the frame first."](SwiftUI-View-1.png)
///
/// If you instead apply the border first, it outlines the text view, which
/// never takes more space than it needs to render its contents.
///
///     Text("Title")
///         .border(Color.gray) // Apply the border first this time.
///         .frame(width: 100)
///
/// Wrapping that view in another invisible one with a fixed 100 point width
/// affects the layout of the composite view, but has no effect on the border.

/// A property wrapper that lets you build views declaratively.
///
/// ``ViewBuilder`` is used extensively in SwiftUI to let you create new
/// on-screen views by just listing them out in a trailing closure.
/// It's a **property wrapper** applied to function parameter.
/// Usually, it's just working behind the scenes, so you don't have to
/// worry about it. But, you can also define your own functions
/// that are view builders, and also include them in your own custom views.
///
/// (A view builder is just specific type of
/// [result builder](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AdvancedOperators.html#ID630)
/// that you can use with ``View``s. Check out that link to learn
/// more about using these to write clean code.)
///
/// ### Using a ``ViewBuilder`` as a trailing closure
///
/// ``ViewBuilder`` works behind the scenes of many common SwiftUI
/// views - like ``VStack`` and ``HStack``. For example, here
/// is the declaration of ``Group``'s initializer:
///
/// ```
/// public init(@ViewBuilder content: () -> Content) {
///     // Implementation here
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Since that last parameter is a ``ViewBuilder``, you can easily create
/// a ``Group`` by passing it a [trailing closure](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html#ID102)
/// stacking views:
///
/// ![1F38B3B4-1BCC-426D-BEB1-D365A09E5C30](1F38B3B4-1BCC-426D-BEB1-D365A09E5C30.png)
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         Group {
///             Text("I'm in the group 😁")
///             Text("Me too 🥂")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Using a ``ViewBuilder`` as a function
///
/// You can also use ``ViewBuilder`` as a function. Just tag your
/// function with `@ViewBuilder`, and use it just like you would with a
/// trailing closure:
///
/// ![5464434F-469F-4385-BFBE-C9B38C911F56](5464434F-469F-4385-BFBE-C9B38C911F56.png)
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         Group(content: contentBuilder)
///     }
///
///     @ViewBuilder
///     func contentBuilder() -> some View {
///         Text("This is another way to create a Group 👥")
///         Text("Just stack the views 🥞")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Using a `ViewBuilder` in your own ``View``s
///
/// Exactly like `Group`, you can also use ``ViewBuilder``s in your own custom
/// views. Just tag the parameter of your ``View``'s initializer with
/// `@ViewBuilder`, and anyone using your view will be able to easily
/// pass you views just by listing them.
///
/// In the example below, we use this technique to create a special
/// type of ``Group`` that makes everything green. Note that ``ViewBuilder``s
/// are actually functions, so in order to get the content they contain,
/// you have to call the function. Below, this is done with `content()`.
///
/// ![79B81C88-83A4-47C2-B3E7-68BAFFB230E4](79B81C88-83A4-47C2-B3E7-68BAFFB230E4.png)
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         GreenGroup {
///             Text("I am green 🤑")
///             Text("Hey same 🐲")
///         }
///     }

///     var body: some Scene {
///         WindowGroup {
///             Text("Bananas")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note:
///
/// - The default implementation of a ``WindowGroup`` allows multiple instances of the window to be created (either using ⌘N , or the "Show Tab Bar" command).
/// - Each instance of a window created from a window group contains the same SwiftUI hierarchy, but maintains an independent state. That means if the user creates two instances of your app's window, each window will maintain its own separate (independent) state, unaffected by what the user does on another window of your app.
///
/// ### Adding a title to a window
///
/// On macOS, a window's title is usually displayed in a window's title bar. A window's title bar contains a centered text item to display the window's title.
///
/// Use `WindowGroup/init(_:content)` to title a window. For example:
///
/// ````
/// @main
/// struct MyApp: App {
///     var body: some Scene {
///         WindowGroup("Fruit App") {
///             Text("Bananas")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ````
///
/// Note: The system may use the provided window title as a part of some default window command names. For example, the "New Window" command would become "New Fruit App Window".
/// [window-commands ->]
/// ### Adding commands to a window group
///
/// On macOS, a window can provide a set of contextual commands as menu items in the menu bar. To add a command menu to a ``WindowGroup``, use `Scene/commands(_:)`.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// @main
/// struct MyApp: App {
///     var body: some Scene {
///         WindowGroup {
///             Text("Bananas")
///         }
///         .commands {
///             CommandMenu("Some Commands") {
///                 Text("A Command")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// [<-]
/// ### Disabling creating multiple window instances
///
/// Currently, SwiftUI offers no canonical way to disable the user from creating multiple instances of a window from a ``WindowGroup`` scene. This can be done in two ways:
///
/// - Using the "New Window" (⌘N) command to create a new window instance
/// - Using the "Show Tab Bar" command, and creating a new tab containing a new window instance
///
/// #### Disabling the "New Window" command
///
/// The "New Window" (⌘N) command can be disabled by replacing the "New Item" command group with an empty command group.
///
/// ```
/// @main
/// struct MyApp: App {
///     var body: some Scene {
///         WindowGroup {
///             Text("Bananas")
///         }
///         .commands {
///             CommandGroup(replacing: .newItem, addition: { })
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Caveat: This does not currently work on macCatalyst (as of Big Sur 11.2).
///
/// #### Disabling the "Show Tab Bar" command
///
/// To disable the "Show Tab Bar" command, use `NSApplication` to iterate over your app's windows at launch and set each window's `tabbingMode` to `.disallowed`.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// @main
/// struct MyApp: App {
///     var body: some Scene {
///         WindowGroup {
///             Text("Bananas")
///                 .onAppear {
///                     NSApplication.shared.windows.forEach({ $0.tabbingMode = .disallowed })
///                 }
///         }
