///
/// `Animatable` is best used via `AnimatableModifier`, which is nothing but a simple protocol that combines `Animatable` and `ViewModifier`. This allows you to decouple the animation effect from the view you want to animate.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ![Animatable Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Animatable-example-1.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var numberOfShakes: CGFloat = 0
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Text("Banana🍌🍌")
///                 .font(.largeTitle)
///                 .modifier(ShakeEffect(shakeNumber: numberOfShakes))
///                 .onAppear {
///                     withAnimation(.easeIn(duration: 2.0)) {
///                         numberOfShakes = 10
///                     }
///                 }
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct ShakeEffect: AnimatableModifier {
///     var shakeNumber: CGFloat = 0
///
///     var animatableData: CGFloat {
///         get {
///             shakeNumber
///         } set {
///             shakeNumber = newValue
///         }
///     }
///
///     func body(content: Content) -> some View {
///         content
///             .offset(x: sin(shakeNumber * .pi * 2) * 10)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This example demonstrates a horizontal "shake effect", applied on a `Text`. When run, the text animates by shaking 10 times. This is achieved by triggering an animation using `withAnimation`, and modifying the `shakeNumber` to go from `0` to `10`.
///
/// Note:
///
/// - `shakeNumber` represents the *progress* of the animation. The SwiftUI runtime can set this value through `animatableData`, and it can be any value between the initial and the final value (`0.0` and `10.0` in this case).
///
/// - `shakeNumber` is a `CGFloat` and not an `Int`. This is because the runtime needs to be able to interpolate fractionally between `0.0` and `10.0` 'shakes' - and it does so by making use of `CGFloat`'s `VectorArithmetic` conformance.
///
/// - The exact mathematical function used to interpolate `shakeNumber` is determined by what type of `Animation` is used in `withAnimation`, to animate the change from `0` shakes to `10` shakes.
///
/// #### Using `AnimatableModifier` to continuously animate a view along a circle
///
/// `AnimatableModifier`, used with `Animation/repeatForever(autoreverses:)` can also be used to create a continuous animation.

/// `Binding` is a property wrapper that creates a connection between stored data, and a view that displays and changes that data. It is a **two-way connection** to a source of truth. It is used to both read the latest value, as well as to set a new value. `Binding` defines a **getter** and a **setter** for a value.
///
/// ### Structure of a `Binding`
///
/// A `Binding` is essentially the following structure:
///
/// ```
/// struct Binding<Value> {
///     let get: () -> Value
///     let set: (Value) -> ()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Creating a `Binding` from `@State `
///
/// A `Binding` typically represents a reference to a mutable source of truth - such as `@State`, `@ObservedObject` or a reference-writable keypath of an object. To create a `Binding` from a mutable source of truth, prefix the variable name for the source of truth with a dollar sign (`$`).
///
/// For example, a `TextField` can be bound to a state variable:
///
/// ![Binding Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Binding-example-1.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var text: String = "🍌🍌"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Text(text)
///         TextField("Placeholder", text: $text)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the example above, the source of truth is a `@State` variable, named `text`. `text`  represents a `String`, whereas `$text` represents a `Binding<String>`. `TextField`'s initializer accepts a placeholder `String` and a `Binding<String>`. In this example, `TextField` requires a `Binding` to the source of truth as `TextField` must be able to *write back* to the `@State` variable (a **mutable** source of truth).
///
/// Recall, a `Binding` is a **two-way connection** to a source of truth. It is used to both read the latest value, as well as to set a new value. In the previous example, the view's initial render will display an editable text of "🍌🍌" on the screen - `TextField` reads the current value of the source of truth `text` via the  `Binding` `$text`. When the user starts editing, `TextField` *writes back* new values to the source of truth `text` via the `Binding`  `$text` once again.
///
/// ### Creating a `Binding` from an `ObservableObject`
///
/// In this example, the source of truth is an observable object `ExampleModel` - stored in a `@StateObject` owned by `ExampleView`:
///
/// ![Binding Example 2](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Binding-example-2.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @StateObject var viewModel = ExampleModel()
///
///     var text: String {
///         viewModel.isEnabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled"
///     }
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Toggle(text, isOn: $viewModel.isEnabled)
///     }
/// }
///
/// class ExampleModel: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var isEnabled: Bool = false
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The binding between the model's `isEnabled` variable and a toggle is established using `$viewModel.isEnabled` within `ExampleView`'s body. Note that the dollar sign must prefix the **root** variable, even in the case where a child member is being referenced. `$viewModel.isEnabled` and `viewModel.$isEnabled` are **not** equivalent. The former creates a `Binding` to `isEnabled`, whereas the latter unwraps the projected value of the `@Published` property wrapper wrapping `isEnabled`.
///
/// ### Animating Updates via a `Binding`
///
/// Since a `Binding` is capable of updating a view's state, the state update can be made to animate with `Binding/animation(_:)`. Usage looks as follows:
///
/// ```
/// $myVariable.animation(.default)
/// ```
///
/// ### Creating a `Binding` from a constant
///
/// At times, you may want to pass a fixed value as a `Binding`. This is possible via `Binding/constant(_:)`, which creates a `Binding` to a fixed value, ignoring any updates from the consumer of the binding.
///
/// Consider `EnvironmentValues/editMode`, for example. A `List` can be forced into active editing by passing a binding to `EditMode.active`.
///
/// ![Binding Example 3](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Binding-example-3.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits = ["🍌", "🍏", "🍑"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             ForEach(fruits, id: \.self) { fruit in
///                 Text(fruit)
///             }
///             .onDelete { offets in
///                 fruits.remove(atOffsets: offets)
///             }
///         }
///         .environment(\.editMode, .constant(.active))
///     }
/// }

///
/// ### Adding Buttons to Containers
///
/// Use buttons for any user interface element that triggers actions on press.
/// Buttons automatically adapt their visual style to match the expected style
/// within these different containers and contexts. For example, to create a
/// list cell that triggers an action when selected by the user, add a button to
/// the list's content. For example:
///
///     // A list of items, where the last row, when triggered,
///     // opens a UI for adding a new item.
///     List {
///         ForEach(items) { item in
///             Text(item.title)
///         }
///         Button("Add Item", action: addItem)
///     }
///
/// Similarly, to create a context menu item that triggers an action, add a
/// button to the menu's content:
///
///     .contextMenu {
///         Button("Cut", action: cut)
///         Button("Copy", action: copy)
///         Button("Paste", action: paste)
///     }
///
/// This pattern extends to most other container views in SwiftUI that have
/// customizable, interactive content, like forms (instances of `Form`).
///
/// ### Styling Buttons
///
/// You can customize a button's appearance and interaction behavior. To add a
/// custom appearance with standard interaction behavior, create a style that
/// conforms to the `ButtonStyle` protocol. To customize both appearance and
/// interaction behavior, create a style that conforms to the
/// `PrimitiveButtonStyle` protocol. To set a specific style for all button

///
///     MyView()
///         .lineLimit(2)
///
/// In some cases, using a dedicated view modifier provides additional

/// `View/preferredColorScheme(_:)` modifier rather than setting
/// `EnvironmentValues/colorScheme` directly to ensure that the new
/// value propagates up to the presenting container when presenting a view

///
///     MyView()

/// #### UTType settings
///
/// In order for any of this to work, your Xcode project will have to define a document type. To do this,

/// 1. Go to the Xcode project settings.
/// 2. Click on your target to the left.

/// ### How it works
///
/// `GeometryReader` can be expressed simply with the following pseudocode:
///
/// ```
/// struct GeometryReader<Content: View> {
///     var content: (GeometryProxy) -> Content
///
///     var body: some View {
///         content(<container geometry>)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the implementation above, `<container geometry>` is an instance of `GeometryProxy`. `GeometryProxy` simply encapsulates the container's frame and safe area insets, provided at runtime by SwiftUI.
///
/// ### `GeometryReader` to get container bounds
///
/// In this example, `GeometryReader` is used to create a view scaled down to exactly half of its parent container:
///
/// ![GeometryReader Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/GeometryReader-example-1.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         GeometryReader { (proxy: GeometryProxy) in
///             Color.green
///                 .frame(
///                     width: proxy.size.width / 2,
///                     height: proxy.size.height / 2
///                 )
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note: `GeometryReader` **fills into** its parent container, and the current default alignment of its content is `.topLeading`. The example above results in a green rectangle aligned to the top left corner of the screen, inset by the screen's safe area. The alignment cannot be overriden, and is liable to change in the future.
///
/// ### `GeometryReader` to get a view's frame
///
/// `GeometryReader` can also be used with`View/background(_:)`, to acquire the geometry of a target view. Consider `SomeView` in the following example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     struct SomeView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Rectangle()
///                 .fill(Color.red)
///                 .frame(width: 500, height: 500)
///         }
///     }
///
///     @State var someFrame: CGRect? // will be updated after the first layout pass
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             SomeView()
///                 .frame(width: 500, height: 500)
///                 .background(
///                     GeometryReader { (proxy: GeometryProxy) -> EmptyView in
///                         if globalFrame != proxy.frame(in: .global) {
///                             DispatchQueue.main.async {
///                                 someFrame = proxy.frame(in: .global)
///                             }
///                         }
///
///                         return EmptyView()
///                     }
///                 )
///             Text("Hello, World!")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that `someFrame` will be updated to hold the frame of `SomeView`, *not* the frame of its container, the `VStack`. This is achieved by forcing a `GeometryReader` as a background of `SomeView`, thereby constraining it to `SomeView`'s bounds.
///
/// This task of acquiring a view's frame can be done in a generic and reusable way using `ViewModifier`:

///
/// You create a label, in its simplest form, by providing a title and the name

/// [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/)
/// collection:
///
///     Label("Lightning", systemImage: "bolt.fill")
///
/// You can also apply styles to labels in several ways. In the case of dynamic
/// changes to the view after device rotation or change to a window size you
/// might want to show only the text portion of the label using the title-only
/// label style:
///
///     Label("Lightning", systemImage: "bolt.fill")
///         .labelStyle(TitleOnlyLabelStyle())
///
/// Conversely, there's also an icon-only label style:
///
///     Label("Lightning", systemImage: "bolt.fill")
///         .labelStyle(IconOnlyLabelStyle())
///
/// You can also create a customized label style by modifying an existing
/// style; this example adds a red border to the default label style:
///
///     struct RedBorderedLabelStyle : LabelStyle {
///         func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {{}
///             Label(configuration)
///                 .border(Color.red)
///         }
///     }
///
/// For more extensive customization or to create a completely new label style,
/// you'll need to adopt the `LabelStyle` protocol and implement a
/// `LabelStyleConfiguration` for the new style.
///
/// To apply a common label style to a group of labels, apply the style
/// to the view hierarchy that contains the labels:
///
///     VStack {
///         Label("Rain", systemImage: "cloud.rain")
///         Label("Snow", systemImage: "snow")
///         Label("Sun", systemImage: "sun.max")
///     }
///     .labelStyle(IconOnlyLabelStyle())
///
/// It's also possible to make labels using views to compose the label's icon
/// programmatically, rather than using a pre-made image. In this example, the
/// icon portion of the label uses a filled `Circle` overlaid
/// with the user's initials:
///
///     Label {
///         Text(person.fullName)
///             .font(.body)
///             .foregroundColor(.primary)
///         Text(person.title)
///             .font(.subheadline)
///             .foregroundColor(.secondary)
///     } icon: {
///         Circle()
///             .fill(person.profileColor)
///             .frame(width: 44, height: 44, alignment: .center)

///
/// ![List Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/List-example-1.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///             Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///             Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Creating a `List` with a variable number of elements
///
/// In the following example, `List/init(_:id:rowContent:)` is used to dynamically create a `List` over an array of strings, `fruits`.
///
/// ![List Example 2](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/List-example-2.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits: [String] = ["Bananas 🍌🍌", "Apples 🍏🍏", "Peaches 🍑🍑"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List.init(fruits, id: /\.self) { (fruit: String) in
///             Text(fruit)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This is different from the previous example, because this initializer accepts a `rowContent` parameter that allows the `List` to generate SwiftUI views for the list's rows on-demand.
///
/// The `id` parameter requires a key-path to the *identifier* for each row of the `List`. This is required so that `List` can efficiently process changes in the data source (in this example, the array `fruits`). These changes to the data source are animated as insertions, removals and reorders - reflecting the changes in the source.
///
/// It is up to the programmer to decide what property best represents the 'identiifer' of a particular type. In this example, the `String` itself is a valid identifier for the data, therefore `\.self` is passed along to the `id` parameter.
///
/// ### Creating a `List` with both fixed and dynamic elements
///
/// `List` allows you to mix both fixed and dynamic elements using `ForEach`.
///
/// The following example displays a `List` of a fixed element ("Hello, World!") followed by dynamic elements from the previous example (using the `fruits` array):
///
/// ![List Example 3](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/List-example-3.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits: [String] = ["Bananas 🍌🍌", "Apples 🍏🍏", "Peaches 🍑🍑"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             Text("Hello, World!")
///
///             ForEach(fruits, id: /\.self) { (fruit: String) in
///                 Text(fruit)
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// As seen in the above example, `ForEach` also accepts an `id` parameter along with a `rowContent`.
///
/// ### Adding sections to a `List`
///
/// The following example demonstrates the usage of `Section`.
///
/// ![List Example 4](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/List-example-4.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits: [String] = ["Bananas 🍌🍌", "Apples 🍏🍏", "Peaches 🍑🍑"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List {

/// ```
///
/// A `Section` used within a `List` will render as a table-section containing the elements wrapped by that section. Just as for unsectioned elements, sections can hold both fixed and dynamic elements.
///
/// ### Styling a `List`
///
/// A `List` can be styled using the `View/listStyle(_:)` modifier.
///
/// The following example demonstrates how to style a `List` to use a grouped-inset style:
///
/// ![List Example 5](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/List-example-5.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///             Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///             Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///         }
///         .listStyle(InsetGroupedListStyle())
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// SwiftUI offers various list styles:
///
/// - `DefaultListStyle`
/// - `GroupedListStyle`
/// - `InsetGroupedListStyle`
/// - `InsetListStyle`
/// - `PlainListStyle`
/// - `SidebarListStyle`
///
/// Note: List styles only modify the appearance of a `List`. They do not affect the order or positioning of rows within the `List`.
///
/// ### Setting the background view for a list row
///
/// Use `View/listRowBackground(_:)` to set the background view for a given row.
///
/// The following example demonstrates how `View/listRowBackground(_:)` can be used to provide specific background colors for a list's rows:
///
/// ![List Example 6](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/List-example-6.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 .listRowBackground(Color.yellow)
///             Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 .listRowBackground(Color.red)
///             Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///                 .listRowBackground(Color.orange)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A background can be provided for multiple list rows at a time, by applying the `View/listRowBackground(_:)` modifier to `ForEach`.
///
/// In the following example, all the rows of the `List` have the background view `Color.yellow`.
///
/// ![List Example 7](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/List-example-7.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits: [String] = ["Bananas 🍌🍌", "Apples 🍏🍏", "Peaches 🍑🍑"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             ForEach(fruits, id: /\.self) { (fruit: String) in
///                 Text(fruit)
///             }
///             .listRowBackground(Color.yellow)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
///
///
/// ### Making list rows deletable
///
/// Apply the `DynamicViewContent/onDelete(_:)` modifier on a `ForEach` within a `List` to allow the list rows to become deletable.
///
/// ![List Example 8](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/List-example-8.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits = ["🍌", "🍏", "🍑"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             List {
///                 ForEach(fruits, id: /\.self) { fruit in
///                     Text(fruit)
///                 }
///                 .onDelete { offsets in
///                     fruits.remove(atOffsets: offsets)
///                 }
///             }
///             .toolbar {
///                 EditButton()
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
///
///
/// ### Editing a `List` using `EditButton`
///
/// An `EditButton` placed in the navigation bar of a `NavigationView` with a `List` in it can be used to provide an edit button for the `List`.
///
/// ![List Example 9](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/List-example-9.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits = ["🍌", "🍏", "🍑"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             List {
///                 ForEach(fruits, id: /\.self) { fruit in
///                     Text(fruit)
///                 }
///                 .onDelete { offets in
///                     fruits.remove(atOffsets: offets)
///                 }
///             }
///             .toolbar {
///                 EditButton()
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Further notes
///
/// Although `List` is very powerful, it currently has some limitations:
///
/// - The separator of a `List` cannot be removed.
/// - `SidebarListStyle` is broken on macCatalyst.

/// - `DefaultListStyle` - provides the default list behavior and appearence for the platform.
/// - `GroupedListStyle` - provides default list behavior for grouped lists, including appropriate formating of section headers.
/// - `InsetGroupedListStyle` - is a variation of GroupedListStyle with insets including row backgrounds with rounded corners.
/// - `InsetListStyle` - is similar to a plain list, but includes additional layout insets.
/// - `PlainListStyle` - provides platform standard list appearance and behavior.
/// - `SidebarListStyle` - provides styling and behavior designed for an application level navigation bar used in iPadOS and MacOS. An example implementation can be found [here](https:swiftwithmajid.com/2020/07/21/sidebar-navigation-in-swiftui/). Currently not working properly on MacCatalyst.
/// - `EllipticalListStyle` - provides an elliptical list experience on WatchOS, including haptic feedback and unique animation when scrolling.
/// - `CarouselListStyle` - provides a coverflow-like experience on WatchOS lists including scroll animations that shrinks cells off-screen.

/// A navigation stack is set up simply by wrapping your view in a `NavigationView`
///
/// ![NavigationView Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NavigationView-example-1.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             Text("Hello Bananas🍌🍌")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A navigation bar is added by default. The navigation bar can be hidden via  `View/navigationBarHidden(_:)`.
///
/// ### Adding a navigation title
///
/// Use `View/navigationTitle(_:)` to add a title to the navigation bar within your `NavigationView`:
///
/// ![NavigationView Example 2](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NavigationView-example-2.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             Text("Hello Bananas🍌🍌")
///                 .navigationTitle("Home")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `View/navigationTitle(_:)` is only available on iOS 14 and higher. If your application targets iOS 13, please use `View/navigationBarTitle(_:)`.
///
/// ### Setting the navigation title display mode
///
/// The display mode of a navigation bar title can be controlled via `View/navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(_:)`. There are two main display modes:
///
/// - `NavigationBarItem.TitleDisplayMode.inline`
/// - `NavigationBarItem.TitleDisplayMode.large`
///
/// An `.automatic` mode is also present, and represents the system default.
///
/// The following example forces a large navigation title:
///
/// ![NavigationView Example 3](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NavigationView-example-3.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             Text("Hello Bananas🍌🍌")
///                 .navigationTitle("Home")
///                 .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.large)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Navigating to a view
///
/// Use `NavigationLink` to add a button that pushes a new view onto the navigation stack.
///
/// For example, the following presents `ApplesView` when the link "I want apples!" is pressed:
///
/// ![NavigationView Example 4](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NavigationView-example-4.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     struct BananasView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("Bananas")
///                 .navigationTitle("🍌🍌")
///         }
///     }
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             NavigationLink(destination: BananasView()) {
///                 Text("I want bananas!")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Hiding the navigation bar
///
/// The navigation bar is on by default within a `NavigationView`. It can be hidden using `View/navigationBarHidden(_:)`.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ![NavigationView Example 5](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NavigationView-example-5.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             Text("Hello Bananas🍌🍌")
///                 .navigationBarHidden(true)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that the navigation bar can be unhidden by child views. `View/navigationBarHidden(_:)` is a *preference value*, and uses the value proposed by the deepest view in the hierarchy as its active value. This is to say, a screen with the navigation bar hidden can push a screen that unhides the bar.
///
/// For example, navigating to `SecondScreen` in the following unhides the bar:
///
/// ![NavigationView Example 6](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NavigationView-example-6.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     struct SecondScreen: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("Bananas🍌🍌")
///                 .navigationTitle("Second Screen")
///                 .navigationBarHidden(false)
///         }
///     }
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Hello Bananas🍌🍌")
///
///                 NavigationLink(destination: SecondScreen()) {
///                     Text("Take me to the second screen!")
///                 }
///             }
///             .navigationBarHidden(true)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And popping `SecondScreen` (or navigating back) hides it again, as `SecondScreen` is removed from the view hierarchy, leaving `ExampleView` as the deepest view in the hierarchy - which has hidden the navigation bar.
///
/// ### Adding navigation bar items
///
/// Use `View/navigationBarItems(leading:trailing:)` to add items to a navigation bar's leading and trailing areas.
///
/// For example, the following adds "🍌🍌" to the leading area, and "🍏🍏" to the trailing area:
///
/// ![NavigationView Example 7](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NavigationView-example-11.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             Text("Hello Bananas🍌🍌")
///                  .navigationBarItems(leading: Text("🍌🍌"), trailing: Text("🍏🍏"))
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Styling a navigation view
///
/// Use `View/navigationViewStyle(_:)` to style a navigation view.
///
/// For example, the following forces a stack-based navigation style, overriding the default double-colum style on macCatalyst:
///
/// ![NavigationView Example 8](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NavigationView-example-8.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             Text("Hello Bananas🍌🍌")
///         }
///         .navigationViewStyle(StackNavigationViewStyle())
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And the following forces a double-column navigation style, overriding the default stack-based navigation style on iPadOS:
///
/// ![NavigationView Example 9](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NavigationView-example-9.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             Text("Hello Bananas🍌🍌")
///         }
///         .navigationViewStyle(DoubleColumnNavigationViewStyle())
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Handling selection
///
/// `NavigationLink` provides the ability to observe and/or set the active navigation selection via its initializer `NavigationLink/init(destination:tag:selection:label)`.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ![NavigationView Example 10](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/NavigationView-example-10.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     enum NavigationItem {
///         case bananas
///         case apples
///         case peaches
///     }
///
///     @State var navigatedItem: NavigationItem? = .bananas
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             NavigationLink(
///                 destination: Text("🍏🍏"),
///                 tag: NavigationItem.apples,
///                 selection: $navigatedItem
///             ) {
///                 Text("Apples")
///             }
///
///             NavigationLink(
///                 destination: Text("🍌🍌"),
///                 tag: NavigationItem.bananas,
///                 selection: $navigatedItem
///             ) {
///                 Text("Bananas")
///             }
///
///             NavigationLink(
///                 destination: Text("🍑🍑"),
///                 tag: NavigationItem.peaches,
///                 selection: $navigatedItem
///             ) {
///                 Text("Peaches")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///

///   children property is `nil`.
/// - `Subgroup`: A type of a view that groups a parent view and a view
///   representing its children, typically with some mechanism for showing and
///   hiding the children

/// ### Modifying and mutating a path
///
/// Use mutating path methods in conjunction with the init-from-a-closure
/// path initializer to mutate the path before returning it. These methods
/// mutate and return the path.
///
/// Use non-mutating (modifying) path methods on already existing paths
/// similarly to view modifiers to update and return something new.
///
/// In the following example, `move(to:)` and `addLine(to:)` are
/// mutating methods, while `stroke()` is a non-mutating method.
///
/// ```
/// struct PathView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         Path { path in
///             path.move(to: .zero)

/// ### Using a path

/// 3. content for the picker to display.
///
/// Set the `selection` parameter to a "current selection" binding.
///
/// Set the label to a view that describes the purpose of selecting content
/// in the picker.
///
/// The content is what the picker displays.
///
/// For example, consider the following enumeration of ice cream flavors:
///
///     enum Flavor: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
///         case chocolate
///         case vanilla
///         case strawberry
///
///         var id: String { self.rawValue }
///     }
///
/// You can create a picker to select among these values by providing `Text`
/// views in the picker initializer's content:
///
/// ![Picker Ice Cream](/picker-ice-cream.png)
///
/// ```
/// struct IceCreamView: View {
///     @State private var selectedFlavor = Flavor.chocolate
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
///             Text("Chocolate 🍫").tag(Flavor.chocolate)
///             Text("Vanilla 🍦").tag(Flavor.vanilla)
///             Text("Strawberry 🍓").tag(Flavor.strawberry)
///         }
///         Text("Selected flavor: \(selectedFlavor.rawValue)")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You append a tag to each text view so that the type of each selection
/// matches the type of the bound state variable.
///
/// ### Iterating Over a Picker’s Options
///
/// To provide selection values for the `Picker` without explicitly listing
/// each option, you can create the picker with a `ForEach` construct, like
/// this:
///
/// ```
/// struct IceCreamView: View {
///     @State private var selectedFlavor = Flavor.chocolate
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
///             ForEach(Flavor.allCases) { flavor in
///                 Text(flavor.rawValue.capitalized)
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this case, `ForEach` automatically assigns a tag to the selection
/// views, using each option's `id`, which it can do because `Flavor` conforms
/// to the [Identifiable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/identifiable)
/// protocol.
///
/// However, if the selection type doesn't match the input to the
/// `ForEach`, you need to provide an explicit tag. The following example
/// shows a picker that has a binding to a `Topping` type, even though the options
/// are all `Flavor` instances. Each option uses `View/tag(_:)` to associate
/// a topping with the flavor it displays.
///
/// ![Picker Toppings](/picker-toppings.png)
///
/// ```
/// enum Flavor: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
///     case chocolate
///     case vanilla
///     case strawberry
///
///     var id: String { self.rawValue }
///     var suggestedTopping: Topping {
///         switch self {
///         case .chocolate:
///             return .nuts
///         case .vanilla:
///             return .cookies
///         case .strawberry:
///             return .blueberries
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// enum Topping: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
///     case nuts
///     case cookies
///     case blueberries
///
///     var id: String { self.rawValue }
/// }
///
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @State private var suggestedTopping: Topping = .cookies
///     var body: some View {
///         Picker("Suggest a topping for:", selection: $suggestedTopping) {
///             ForEach(Flavor.allCases) { flavor in
///                 Text(flavor.rawValue.capitalized)
///                     .tag(flavor.suggestedTopping)
///             }
///         }
///         Text("suggestedTopping: \(suggestedTopping.rawValue)")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Styling Pickers
///
/// You can customize the appearance and interaction of pickers by creating

///             }

///         }

///
/// Scenes can either be custom, or one of the primitives like `WindowGroup` or
/// `DocumentGroup`.
///
/// ### Creating a Scene
///
/// #### Using primitive Scenes
///
/// Primitive scenes like `WindowGroup` can go directly in the body of your `App`.
///
/// ![Scene Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Scene-example-1.png)
///
///     @main
///     struct SuperSimpleApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 Text("This is an entire app! 🙌")
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// #### Using custom Scenes
///
/// Just like how custom `View`s are made out of a `var body` of smaller  `View`s,
/// custom `Scene`s are made out of a `var body` of smaller `Scene`s.
///
/// ![Scene Example 2](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Scene-example-2.png)
///
///     @main
///     struct MacCompatibleApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             CustomScene()
///         }
///
///     struct CustomScene: Scene {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 Text("This is a mac-compatible app! 💻")
///             }
///
///             #if os(macOS)
///             Settings {
///                 SettingsView()
///             }
///             #endif
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Modifiers
///
/// Just like how `Views` have a bunch of custom modifiers that work right out of the box,
/// `Scene` provides default implementations of many useful modifiers. These can be used to do things
/// like adding macOS commands, changing the toolbar, and adding support for app storage.
///
/// ### Getting Scene Status
///
/// The `EnvironmentValues/scenePhase` environment value can easily be read in a scene
/// to respond to whether the scene is active or in another state. It returns an enumeration of type
/// `ScenePhase`.
///
///     struct StateAdaptingScene: Scene {

/// multiple scene instances created from a single scene declaration; for
/// example, from a `WindowGroup`. When an app enters the
/// `ScenePhase/background` phase, expect the app to terminate soon after.
/// You can use that opportunity to free any resources:
///

/// A view that scrolls.
///
/// A view that allows the scrolling of its contained views.
///
/// ### Making a view scrollable
///
/// `ScrollView` is a container view that makes its content scrollable. For example:
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-1.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, the `VStack` containing the text is made scrollable by wrapping it in a `ScrollView`.
///
/// Note:
///
/// - The content of a `ScrollView` is scrollable regardless of whether all of it fits on screen or not.
/// - It is not possible to selectively disable the scrolling of a `ScrollView`, while allowing its content to remain interactive. A `View/disabled(_:)` attached to a `ScrollView` will disable both the scrolling and all the interaction with the content visible.
/// - A `ScrollView`'s scrollable region is sized to fit the content view passed to the `ScrollView`.
/// - `ScrollView` fits to occupy as much space as possible. It is important to distinguish between the actual bounds of the scroll view, and the bounds of the *content* of the `ScrollView`.
///
/// ### Setting the direction of scrolling
///
/// The default scrolling direction of a `ScrollView` is **vertical**. `ScrollView` supports 3 types of scrolling:
///
/// - vertical
/// - horizontal
/// - both vertical and horizontal
///
/// To set a single allowed direction for a `ScrollView`, specify the axis of direction in the initializer. For example:
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 2](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-2.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView(.horizontal) {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This example takes the previous example, and modifies it so that the `ScrollView` scrolls horizontally. This `ScrollView` will **not** scroll vertically, as an explict axis, `.horizontal`, has been specified.
///
/// To allow *both* directions of scrolling, pass the set of axes that you want to permit. For example:
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 3](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-3.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView([.horizontal, .vertical]) {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, `ScrollView` can scroll both horizontally *and* vertically, because both axes have been specified explicitly.
///
/// ### Hiding the scroll view indicator
///
/// By default, a `ScrollView`'s scroll indicator is visible upon user interaction.
///
/// Pass `false` to `showsIndicators` in `ScrollView/init(_:showsIndicators:content)` to hide the scroll indicator(s). For example:
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 4](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-4.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView(.horizontal, showsIndicators: false) {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This `ScrollView` will never show a scroll indicator.
///
/// You do not need to specify an axis to use `showsIndicators`. For example:
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 5](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-5.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView(showsIndicators: false) {
///             VStack {
///                 Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This `ScrollView`  hides its scroll indicator, with a default `.vertical` scroll direction.
///
/// ### Scrolling to an item
///
/// To programmatically scroll to a particular item in your `ScrollView`, use `ScrollViewProxy/scrollTo(_:anchor:)`. `ScrollViewProxy` is a type that allows you to control a `ScrollView`, and can be obtained using a `ScrollViewReader`.
///
/// For example:
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 6](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-6.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView {
///             ScrollViewReader { (proxy: ScrollViewProxy) in
///                 Button("Jump to #32") {
///                     proxy.scrollTo(32)
///                 }
///
///                 ForEach(1..<101) { number in
///                     Text("Item #\(number)")
///                         .id(number)
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, clicking the button reading "Jump to #32", will cause the `ScrollView` to scroll to the item with the ID of the value `32`. To assign an ID to a view, use `View/id(_:)` as is done inside the `ForEach`, for each element.
///
/// The call of `proxy.scrollTo(32)` causes the `ScrollView` to scroll to the text reading "Item #32", with that text centered vertically in the `ScrollView`'s bounds. To change the anchor of the finalled scrolled-to destination, specify an anchor via `ScrollViewProxy/scrollTo(_:anchor:)`. For example:
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 7](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-7.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         ScrollView {
///             ScrollViewReader { (proxy: ScrollViewProxy) in
///                 Button("Jump to #32") {
///                     proxy.scrollTo(32, anchor: .top)
///                 }
///
///                 ForEach(1..<101) { number in
///                     Text("Item #\(number)")
///                         .id(number)
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, the `ScrollView` still scrolls to "Item #32", but this `Text` is seen at the top of the `ScrollView`, rather than it's vertical center. The `anchor` parameter uses a type, `UnitPoint`, to determine the relative alignment (relative to the scroll view's bounds) of the scrolled-to item.
///
///
///  Add a transition to your `ScrollViewProxy/scrollTo(_:anchor:)` with `View/withAnimation(_:_:)`.  For example:
///
///  ![ScrollView Example 8](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ScrollView-example-8.gif)
///
///  ```
///  struct ExampleView: View {
///      var body: some View {
///          ScrollView {
///              ScrollViewReader { (proxy: ScrollViewProxy) in
///                  Button("Jump to #32") {
///                     withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 60)) {
///                         proxy.scrollTo(32, anchor: .top)
///                     }
///                  }
///
///                  ForEach(1..<101) { number in
///                      Text("Item #\(number)")
///                          .id(number)
///                  }
///              }
///          }

///
/// To disable page indicators altogether, apply a `PageIndexViewStyle` using `View/indexViewStyle(_:)`, like so:

/// ### Handling tab-selection
///
/// `TabView` provides the ability to observe and/or set the active tab selection via its initializer `TabView/init(selection:content)`, and the modifier `View/tag(_:)`.
///
/// Here is an example that writes tab selection to a state variable:
///
/// ![TabView Example 5](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/TabView-example-5.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     enum TabItem {

///         case peaches
///     }
///
///     @State var selectedItem: TabItem = .bananas

///         TabView(selection: $selectedItem) {
///             Text("Bananas 🍌🍌")
///                 .tabItem {
///                     Image(systemName: "1.circle.fill")
///                     Text("🍌🍌")
///                 }
///                 .tag(TabItem.bananas)
///
///             Text("Apples 🍏🍏")
///                 .tabItem {
///                     Image(systemName: "2.square.fill")

///
///             Text("Peaches 🍑🍑")
///                 .tabItem {
///                     Image(systemName: "3.square.fill")

///                 .font(.custom("HelveticaNeue", size: 13))
///         }
///     }
///

///
/// ### Setup
///
/// To implement a `UIViewRepresentable`, you must implement four main lifecycle functions:
///
/// - `UIViewRepresentable/makeCoordinator()`
/// - `UIViewRepresentable/makeUIView(context:)`
/// - `UIViewRepresentable/updateUIView(_:context:)`
/// - `UIViewRepresentable/dismantleUIView(context:)` (this is optional, a default implementation is provided if left unimplemented)
///
/// The SwiftUI runtime:
///
/// - Creates a `Coordinator` using `makeCoordinator()` if necessary.
/// - Calls `UIViewRepresentable/makeUIView(context:) to create an instance of your` `UIViewType`.
/// - `UIViewRepresentable/updateUIView(_:context:)` is immediately called *once* after the call to `UIViewRepresentable/makeUIView(context:)` .
/// - Upon any state changes, calls  `UIViewRepresentable/updateUIView(_:context:)`
/// - Upon destruction of the parent container, calls `UIViewRepresentable/dismantleUIView(context:)`
///
/// ### Port a simple `UIView`
///
/// To port a simple UIKit view, `UIActivityIndicatorView`, you could use the following setup:
///
/// ```
/// struct ActivityIndicator: UIViewRepresentable {
///     typealias Context = UIViewRepresentableContext<Self>
///     typealias UIViewType = UIActivityIndicatorView
///
///     let isAnimated: Bool
///
///     public func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UIViewType {
///         UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .medium) // create the instance of the view
///     }
///
///     public func updateUIView(_ uiView: UIViewType, context: Context) {
///         // Check if isAnimated is true, and if the view is inactive.
///         if isAnimated && !uiView.isAnimating {
///             uiView.startAnimating() // Animate
///         }
///
///         // Check if isAnimated is false, and if the view is active.
///         if !isAnimated && uiView.isAnimating {
///             uiView.stopAnimating() // Stop animating
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note:
///
/// - In `updateUIView(_:context:)`, you must handle `isAnimated` being either `true` or `false`.
/// - No redundant calls are made to `startAnimating` and `stopAnimating`. Redundant calls are guarded against by checking whether `uiView.isAnimating` is true or not. This is a general principle for optimizing the performance of your `UIViewRepresentable`.
///
/// Having implemented it as a `UViewRepresentable`, you could now use it in SwiftUI. For example:
///
/// ![UIViewRepresentable Example 1](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/UIViewRepresentable-example-1.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var isAnimating: Bool = false
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Toggle("Animating", isOn: $isAnimating)
///
///             ActivityIndicator(isAnimated: isAnimating)
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct ActivityIndicator: UIViewRepresentable {
///     typealias Context = UIViewRepresentableContext<Self>
///     typealias UIViewType = UIActivityIndicatorView
///
///     let isAnimated: Bool
///
///     public func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UIViewType {
///         UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .medium) // create the instance of the view
///     }
///
///     public func updateUIView(_ uiView: UIViewType, context: Context) {
///         // Check if isAnimated is true, and if the view is inactive.
///         if isAnimated && !uiView.isAnimating {
///             uiView.startAnimating() // Animate
///         }
///
///         // Check if isAnimated is false, and if the view is active.
///         if !isAnimated && uiView.isAnimating {
///             uiView.stopAnimating() // Stop animating
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, the `ActivityIndicator` from before is used and can be toggled by passing a boolean to `ActivityIndicator/init(isAnimated:)`.
///
/// ### Context-aware `UIViewRepresentable`s
///
/// SwiftUI heavily relies on the environment, by way of environment objects (`View/environmentObject(_:)`) and environment values (`EnvironmentValues`). The latter – environment values – are useful for creating intelligent and context-aware UIKit ports.
///
/// For example, we can remove the `isAnimated` parameter from `ActivityIndicator`, and use `isEnabled` from the environment instead  via `EnvironmentValues/isEnabled`:
///
/// ```
/// struct ActivityIndicator: UIViewRepresentable {
///     typealias Context = UIViewRepresentableContext<Self>
///     typealias UIViewType = UIActivityIndicatorView
///
///     public func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UIViewType {
///         UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .medium) // create the instance of the view

///
/// ### Implementing UIKit delegates for a `UIViewRepresentable`
///
/// UIKit views often require delegates to communicate events and pass data back and forth with their view controllers. Since SwiftUI is all about modularity and componentization, there is no concept of a "view controller". View representables use the concept of a 'coordinator' to port views reliant on the delegate pattern.
///
/// For example, here is an example port of `UISearchBar`:
///
/// ```
/// struct SearchBar: UIViewRepresentable {
///     class Coordinator: NSObject, UISearchBarDelegate {
///         @Binding var text: String
///
///         init(text: Binding<String>) {
///             _text = text
///         }
///
///         func searchBar(_ searchBar: UISearchBar, textDidChange searchText: String) {
///             self.text = searchText // set the binding's value to the latest search bar text
///         }
///     }
///
///     let placeholder: String
///
///     @Binding var text: String
///
///     func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {
///         Coordinator(text: self.$text) // create an instance of Coordinator
///     }
///
///     func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UISearchBar {
///         let searchBar = UISearchBar(frame: .zero)
///
///         searchBar.placeholder = placeholder
///         searchBar.delegate = context.coordinator
///
///         return searchBar
///     }
///
///     func updateUIView(_ uiView: UISearchBar, context: Context) {
///         uiView.text = text // set the search bar's text to the value of the binding
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A search bar is a good example of a complex UIKit view. It is a control responsible for text input with multiple lifecycle events, and it uses the delegate pattern to inform the observer whenever these events occur. In SwiftUI, data is passed using bindings, and there is no concept of a delegate.
///
/// The `Coordinator` is the glue between a SwiftUI-style binding-pattern and a UIKit-style delegate-pattern. A `Coordinator` is a state object created and maintained for the lifetime of a `UIViewRepresentable`, that typically implements the primary delegate for the UIKit view being ported. In this case, the `UIViewType` is `UISearchBar` and its primary delegate type is `UISearchBarDelegate`.
///
/// Text input controls in SwiftUI often take a `Binding<String>` in their initializer, and use it to get/set the latest text entered by the user via control. It's extremely important to note that bindings are bidirectional, because SwiftUI ports of UIKit views must also **get** the latest input from the `Binding`. UIKit patterns typically only require notifying the observer and thus setting the values, but in SwiftUI it is imperative to handle both to be a good SwiftUI citizen.
///
/// Here is example of using the search part port:
///
/// ![UIViewRepresentable Example 4](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/UIViewRepresentable-example-4.gif)
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var searchText: String = ""
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             SearchBar(placeholder: "Enter something here", text: $searchText)
///
///             Text("Entered text: /\(searchText)")
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct SearchBar: UIViewRepresentable {
///     class Coordinator: NSObject, UISearchBarDelegate {
///         @Binding var text: String
///
///         init(text: Binding<String>) {
///             &#x5f;text = text
///         }
///
///         func searchBar(&#x5f; searchBar: UISearchBar, textDidChange searchText: String) {
///             self.text = searchText // set the binding's value to the latest search bar text
///         }
///     }
///
///     let placeholder: String
///
///     @Binding var text: String
///
///     func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {
///         Coordinator(text: self.$text) // create an instance of Coordinator
///     }
///
///     func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UISearchBar {
///         let searchBar = UISearchBar(frame: .zero)
///
///         searchBar.placeholder = placeholder
///         searchBar.delegate = context.coordinator
///
///         return searchBar
///     }
///
///     func updateUIView(_ uiView: UISearchBar, context: Context) {
///         uiView.text = text // set the search bar's text to the value of the binding
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, `SearchBar` is bound to a state variable, `searchText`. To confirm that values are being written as they are input, a `Text` reflects the latest value of the state variable. *Note* that if `searchText`'s initial value is used to set the initial text of the `UISearchBar` represented by `SearchBar`. This means if the initial value of `searchText` was set to `"Bananas 🍌🍌"`, `SearchBar` would have an initial search text of `"Bananas 🍌🍌"` already loaded.
///
/// ### Further notes
///
/// - Creating UIKit views are expensive. That is why they are done once per lifetime of a `UIViewRepresentable`.
/// - Because the *same* `UIViewType` instance is reused as much as possible, `UIViewRepresentable/updateUIView(_:context:)` is responsible for making sure that the parameters passed via the initializer, and the SwiftUI environment, are always in sync with the UIKit view being managed by the representable.

///         var body: some View {

///
/// Assemble the view's body by combining one or more of the primitive views
/// provided by SwiftUI, like the `Text` instance in the example above, plus
/// other custom views that you define, into a hierarchy of views.
///
/// The `View` protocol provides a large set of modifiers, defined as protocol
/// methods with default implementations, that you use to position and configure
/// views in the layout of your app. Modifiers typically work by wrapping the
/// view instance on which you call them in another view with the specified
/// characteristics. For example, adding the `View/opacity(_:)` modifier to a
/// text view returns a new view with some amount of transparency:
///
///     Text("Hello, World!")
///         .opacity(0.5) // Display partially transparent text.
///
/// The effects of a modifier typically propagate to any child views that don't
/// explicitly override the modifier. For example, a `VStack` instance on its
/// own acts only to vertically stack other views, and has no text to display.
/// Therefore, a `View/font(_:)` modifier that you apply to the stack has no
/// effect on the stack itself. Yet the font modifier does apply to any of the
/// stack's child views, some of which might display text. On the other hand,
/// you can locally override the stack's modifier by adding another to a
/// specific child view:
///
///     VStack {
///         Text("Title")
///             .font(.headline) // Override the font of this one view.
///         Text("First body line.")
///         Text("Second body line.")
///     }
///     .font(.body) // Set a default for text in the stack.
///
/// You commonly chain modifiers, each wrapping the result of the previous one.
/// For example, you can wrap a text view in an invisible box with a given width
/// using the `View/frame(width:height:alignment:)` modifier to influence its
/// layout, and then use the `View/border(_:width:)` modifier to draw an
/// outline around that:
///
///     Text("Title")
///         .frame(width: 100)
///         .border(Color.gray)
///
/// The order in which you apply modifiers matters. For example, the border that
/// results from the above code outlines the full width of the frame.
///
/// ![A screenshot of a text view displaying the string "Title", outlined by a
/// gray rectangle that's wider than the string it encloses, leaving empty space
/// inside the rectangle on either side of the string. A caption reads, "Apply
/// the frame first."](SwiftUI-View-1.png)
///
/// If you instead apply the border first, it outlines the text view, which
/// never takes more space than it needs to render its contents.
///
///     Text("Title")
///         .border(Color.gray) // Apply the border first this time.
///         .frame(width: 100)
///
/// Wrapping that view in another invisible one with a fixed 100 point width
/// affects the layout of the composite view, but has no effect on the border.
