# BananaDocs
SwiftUI Documentation Project 

This project is a massive undertaking! Our dream is for this to be a fully community maintained project – where the community earns 100% of their banana🍌 work.
If you want to help us document, open a PR with changes. 

If you want to see the current status of documentation, feel free to check out bananadocs.org!!

It's really important to follow the documentation Template in the wiki when making any changes.
